  <p>The happier you are when you look at your terminal the happier you will be when coding.
More Happy means more coding.

<p>This same principle applies for all text editors/IDEs (integrated developer environment) by the way.
It sounds like a joke, but seriously, take some time to have a nice looking coding environment.</p>

<p>In order to change them, you should be able to create a default profile for most terminal emulators and change the color scheme, opacity, font, background image, etc.</p>

<p>REORG this to be each headers is a Terminal Emulator</p>

<h2 id="open-terminal">Open Terminal</h2>

<p>Each Terminal Emulator has its own method of configuring its preferences.
Here I will show you the general struture for how to change them for each of the major types.
Once you know how to configure the settings for your prefered terminal emulator you can skip to the section about some <a href="#general-customization">reccomended settings</a> and continue following along with the .</p>

<p>All OSes have some type of terminal emulator, by default by there are some subtle differences between them, so I describe each separately. So read through the section that is relevant to you before skipping to the next <a href="#customization">section</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gui-customization-iterm2-and-macos-default-terminal">GUI Customization (iTerm2 and MacOS Default Terminal)</h3>

<p>Regardless if you choose the default Mac Terminal or iTerm2, they both have the same customization structure.
First you need to open up the preferences (keyboard shortcut: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">⌘</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>; or click from the topdown menu).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/iterm-pref.png" alt="Preferences Image for iTerm2" /></p>

<p>The next few options are iTerm2 specific if you want to add these customization options.</p>

<p>Option 1: Repeat some steps multiple times (obviously not ideal)
Option 2: Now that you know how basic customization works, jump down to the general customization suggestions sections.</p>

<h3 id="config-file-customization-kitty-and-alacritty">Config File Customization (Kitty and Alacritty)</h3>

<p>As the name implies, gitbash only lets you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code>, so you do not have access to all the niceties for customization as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zsh</code>.
As such, you unfortunately, have a bit more complicated customization process.
It is a bit to much to explain in this simple blog post, so here is a good <a href="https://blog.devgenius.io/how-to-customize-the-git-bash-shell-prompt-336f6aefcf3f">post</a> to get you started.</p>

<h2 id="general-customization">General Customization</h2>

<h2 id="zsh-specific-customization"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Zsh</code> Specific Customization</h2>

<p>Although many Linux distros have switch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zsh</code> not all of them have, so make sure you are using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zsh</code> before using these customization options</p>

<p>I will say that for Mac users specifically, I would reccomend you check out <a href="https://iterm2.com/" title="iTerm2 Terminal Emulator">iTerm2</a> as an alternative to the standard terminal and <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/" title="Oh My Zsh: Prettify you Terminal">oh my zsh</a> to add some amazing color theming for some general improvements. 
But of course this is not necessary. <em>Mac users, I will be uploading an install script to match my own setup. And a link to it will be updated here.</em></p>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>
<p>the text there is there now</p>

<h3 id="colors">Colors</h3>

<p>Show how to do a few in practice, then talk about color schemes (Dracula, Dracula,… Dracula)</p>

<h3 id="customizing-your-prompt">Customizing your prompt</h3>

<p>There tons of customization options</p>

<p>Show one example of changing the prompt from bashrc (link to later files).</p>

<p>Then point out powerlevels10k and the one from TechCrafted, I dont remember the name</p>
