By the end of this you will know: Basic commands to traverse your computer from the terminal The structure or commands, arguments, and options in bash How to edit, create, move and delete files Create a script to make a folder structure for each new project you are working on. Prerequisites: None; Although it may be helpful to have read through the series intro Knowing Your Way Around with bash When you first learn bash there are three must learn commands. These are really important commands because they allow you to navigate around your file system: pwd: Print Working Directory cd: Change Directory ls: LiSt (Contents) An analogy that I like to use for these commands is imaging you are on a random street in a US city that you donâ€™t know. The pwd command is like looking up your current address. It will tell you were you are. The ls command would be like looking around the street (or on your map) to see what restruants are on the street. And cd would be like moving to a new location. In keeping with the analogy, you canâ€™t just move to an arbritrary new street because you donâ€™t know this city. Instead you have to give precise directions either from where you are currently or relative to some clearly visable space (say a big colorful building you can see from anywhere in the city). Now letâ€™s see these in action. pwd The pwd command shows where you are currently located in your filesystem and is equivalent to getwd() in R or os.getcwd() in python. You will notice that in this tutorial, I have all the code as an image instead of code based text that you can copy. This was done intentionally because as you first start out, you could be typing these commands in so you get used to them. So for each image, you should be typing out the command on your own terminal and confirming you get similar results. As you can see I am in my users home directory (a special location, and super common, location in your files; on Mac its /user/USERNAME on linux its /home/USERNAME). This is a super common place, so it has a shortcut that can be accessed with ~ called the tilde and its above tab and to the left of the 1 on the keyboard. The ~ can be used to access your home directory (a directory is just another name for a folder) anywhere on your computer. Youâ€™ll see more of it later. ls So the pwd command tells you were you are, the ls command letâ€™s you look around at the current location, to know what is around you. So in terms of your filesystem the ls command lists all directories and files inside the specified directory (defaults to your current working directory if no directory path is specified). I have mine set up to give different colors to folder, which you can ignore for now (at the end of this series I will show you have to customize your terminal to have a fancy terminal as well). Arugments The ls command can also take input arguments. Arguments are inputs to a command to adjust its functionality. In the case of the ls command you are add a path as an argument, so instead of listing the contents of the current directory, it will list the contents of the specified directory. Lets try it with our downloads folder: Note: That unlike most other programming languages, bash does not use parentheses to enclose the arguments. Each on is simply separated by white space. ðŸ˜² Uh-ohh, we got an error, what happened? The ls command already said that we have a downloads folder. Reading the error it says that there is no downloads folder, but thats weird we just saw it in the previous command, what gives? Wellâ€¦ this is an important lesson. All shell commands are CASE SENSITIVE. So, while we have a Downloads folder, we do not have a folder called downloads. That was the problem. When we correct the case we get this output. As you can see, I have a bunch of junk in my downloads folder, which I should probably clean out. But, more importantnly, the command worked now that we made sure that we had the correct case. To help with the case problem, I personally only used lowercase in my directory and file names. This helps out a lot. I also avoid spaces in file/directory names because to access them you need to prepend the space with a \, so if you had a file calle my first directory you would need to access it with ls my\ first\ directory. So its best to avoid spaces altogether. Its really important to actually try to impletment these new commands, you will not learn them just by reading this post, you have to actually try them out. So take a couple mins now to list out the contents of different directories on your computer. Options In addition to argumnets commands can also have options. Options typically change how the output is displayed, compared to arugments, which typically affect what the function is performed on. One simple example of a command is ls -G. Test it out to see what it does. Options as implied by the name are optional, and tend to either be a single - if the option is a single letter (like the -G example) or two -- if its a word. For example, ls --all (or the shorthand: ls -a) shows all files and directories including the hidden files and directories. A hidden file and a hidden directory are just one that starts with a .. By default, your OS will hide files and folders starting with . when looking for things. The ls -a will reveal their secrets. Here, I am showing a git repository that has a few hidden folders that would not have been shown without the -a option nor would they be shown in Finder/Window Explorer. In this case, the .git folder is one example. There are tons of other useful options for ls. Here are a few noteworthy one. -l will Long list you files, so it will print out all the metadata as well. -lhwill long list them in a Human readable format, so you dont have to convert everything from bytes, it will show you them in eith MB, GB, etc, depending on size. Note that you can combine these options, so try to guess what ls -lha would do, then confirm your hypothesis by running the command. Autocomplete One incredibly useful technique is autocomplete. Anytime you are using the terminal (this also works for most other languages as well), you can hit the tab key to autocomplete your command. For example, if I wanted to access the contents of the Desktop, I could type the full thing out or I could just type ls Desk and press the tab key and it will autocomplete to ls Desktop. Taking autocomplete one step further, you can actually acess use tab to list out the contents. So letâ€™s say, as is the case for me, you have a folder in your Downloads, but you werent quite sure what you called it. You could type out ls Dow pres tab to autocomplete to ls Downloads/ the press tab twice to list out the contents of your folder like this: Your browser does not support the video tag. now you remember that it was called temp so you can type the t and hit autocomplete (or you could just continously hit tab to cycle through the options). Pretty neat huh, this technique will save you a ton of time, not only because you donâ€™t have to type as much, but also so you donâ€™t accidently swap cases or make a typo. Importantly autocomplete will work on all shell commands (and many other programming langauges as well), so make sure to keep it in mind for the future commands as well. Now that you know about autocomplete, I want you to take a few more mins listing out the contents of your directories, but also I want you to have side by side the finder window open to the corresponding folder. Notice how much longer it takes to traverse through the contents when using a the GUI compared to the command line. Of course as you improve you are only going to get better, until you are blazingly fast! Hint: For zsh users you can even type out partial directories and have your shell complete e.g., cd Do/te then hit tab it will give you cd Downloads/temp. cd The counter part pwd is the cd command, which in the analogy allows you to move from one location to another. In your filesystem that means cd command allows you to change your current working directory similar to os.setwd in R and os.chdir() in python. As described in the analogy, the cd command helps us move around in our filesystem. The pwd command showed we were in our home directory, but we used the cd command just now to move to our Desktop folder. This is just like if you had Finder or Windows Explore open to that location and move through your files by double clicking the folder icon. In fact, now is an excellent time for you to open your files app and place it side by side with your terminal, that way you can see exactly what is happening in both. With the cd command you can specify the location, but like I said in the analogy at the beginnner, you donâ€™t know this place, so you have to give precise directions either from where you currently are (relative path), or from a well known place (absolute path). The well known, highly visisble place in your filesystem is that home directory (or your root directory noted with /). Now that we are in the Desktop, you can see the pwd command changes its output to reflect our new current working directory. While we are here, of course we can still use the ls command to see the contents of the Desktop; however, now that we are currently inside the Desktop folder we can no longer just type ls Downloads. Again, this is because we are in the Desktop folder, and the Desktop folder does NOT have a Downloads folder. This would be like clicking the Downloads folder inside of the Desktop folder on the GUI, you canâ€™t because its not there. So if we want to access the contents of the Downloads folder we have few options. First, we could simply cd back into our home folder. Since the home folder is one folder above the Desktop folder, we could use the shortcut to move up one folder cd ... Alternatively, since we are specifically trying to go to our home folder, we could also use the special ~ character with cd ~. Then once you changed your current working directory you could use ls Downloads to access that directories contents. The other option is to use these techniques along with the ls command. So we could use ls ../Downloads or ls ls ~/Downloads/. Personally, I switch back an for depending on my needs. For example, if I am nested deep inside a folder structure I might just use ~ but if I am just one folder off I would use ... Now, you should be able to try out cding around your different folder (try hidden ones too!) and use pwd to know where you are and ls to see what is around you. Try to make sure you are using all the commands and options we talk about so far. Also test out what happens when you do cd ../.. Recap We covered a lot just now, so letâ€™s recap. You learned how the pwd, ls, and the cd commands can be used to look around you computer. You also learn how some commands can have arguments to change what they perform their action on, and options which affect how the output is shown. Finally, you learned about the special ~ character to always return home. First of all, these new skills alone are pretty cool and you should pat yourself on the back for your new skills. However, I do want to show you one quite new things, just to spark your interest for the next tutorial. When I saw this in action the first time my mind exploded ðŸ¤¯, and I genuinely tried to show everyone I knew. To get the full effect, I recommand you cd to your Desktop but make sure your Desktop is still visible, so you can see if anything changes. Then try running any of the tree commands: mkdir my_first_dir touch my_first_file.txt echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot; &gt;&gt; my_first_file_with_text.txt" />

Here, I am showing a git repository that has a few hidden folders that would not have been shown without the -a option nor would they be shown in Finder/Window Explorer. In this case, the .git folder is one example. There are tons of other useful options for ls. Here are a few noteworthy one. -l will Long list you files, so it will print out all the metadata as well. -lhwill long list them in a Human readable format, so you dont have to convert everything from bytes, it will show you them in eith MB, GB, etc, depending on size. Note that you can combine these options, so try to guess what ls -lha would do, then confirm your hypothesis by running the command. Autocomplete One incredibly useful technique is autocomplete. Anytime you are using the terminal (this also works for most other languages as well), you can hit the tab key to autocomplete your command. For example, if I wanted to access the contents of the Desktop, I could type the full thing out or I could just type ls Desk and press the tab key and it will autocomplete to ls Desktop. Taking autocomplete one step further, you can actually acess use tab to list out the contents. So letâ€™s say, as is the case for me, you have a folder in your Downloads, but you werent quite sure what you called it. You could type out ls Dow pres tab to autocomplete to ls Downloads/ the press tab twice to list out the contents of your folder like this: Your browser does not support the video tag. now you remember that it was called temp so you can type the t and hit autocomplete (or you could just continously hit tab to cycle through the options). Pretty neat huh, this technique will save you a ton of time, not only because you donâ€™t have to type as much, but also so you donâ€™t accidently swap cases or make a typo. Importantly autocomplete will work on all shell commands (and many other programming langauges as well), so make sure to keep it in mind for the future commands as well. Now that you know about autocomplete, I want you to take a few more mins listing out the contents of your directories, but also I want you to have side by side the finder window open to the corresponding folder. Notice how much longer it takes to traverse through the contents when using a the GUI compared to the command line. Of course as you improve you are only going to get better, until you are blazingly fast! Hint: For zsh users you can even type out partial directories and have your shell complete e.g., cd Do/te then hit tab it will give you cd Downloads/temp. cd The counter part pwd is the cd command, which in the analogy allows you to move from one location to another. In your filesystem that means cd command allows you to change your current working directory similar to os.setwd in R and os.chdir() in python. As described in the analogy, the cd command helps us move around in our filesystem. The pwd command showed we were in our home directory, but we used the cd command just now to move to our Desktop folder. This is just like if you had Finder or Windows Explore open to that location and move through your files by double clicking the folder icon. In fact, now is an excellent time for you to open your files app and place it side by side with your terminal, that way you can see exactly what is happening in both. With the cd command you can specify the location, but like I said in the analogy at the beginnner, you donâ€™t know this place, so you have to give precise directions either from where you currently are (relative path), or from a well known place (absolute path). The well known, highly visisble place in your filesystem is that home directory (or your root directory noted with /). Now that we are in the Desktop, you can see the pwd command changes its output to reflect our new current working directory. While we are here, of course we can still use the ls command to see the contents of the Desktop; however, now that we are currently inside the Desktop folder we can no longer just type ls Downloads. Again, this is because we are in the Desktop folder, and the Desktop folder does NOT have a Downloads folder. This would be like clicking the Downloads folder inside of the Desktop folder on the GUI, you canâ€™t because its not there. So if we want to access the contents of the Downloads folder we have few options. First, we could simply cd back into our home folder. Since the home folder is one folder above the Desktop folder, we could use the shortcut to move up one folder cd ... Alternatively, since we are specifically trying to go to our home folder, we could also use the special ~ character with cd ~. Then once you changed your current working directory you could use ls Downloads to access that directories contents. The other option is to use these techniques along with the ls command. So we could use ls ../Downloads or ls ls ~/Downloads/. Personally, I switch back an for depending on my needs. For example, if I am nested deep inside a folder structure I might just use ~ but if I am just one folder off I would use ... Now, you should be able to try out cding around your different folder (try hidden ones too!) and use pwd to know where you are and ls to see what is around you. Try to make sure you are using all the commands and options we talk about so far. Also test out what happens when you do cd ../.. Recap We covered a lot just now, so letâ€™s recap. You learned how the pwd, ls, and the cd commands can be used to look around you computer. You also learn how some commands can have arguments to change what they perform their action on, and options which affect how the output is shown. Finally, you learned about the special ~ character to always return home. First of all, these new skills alone are pretty cool and you should pat yourself on the back for your new skills. However, I do want to show you one quite new things, just to spark your interest for the next tutorial. When I saw this in action the first time my mind exploded ðŸ¤¯, and I genuinely tried to show everyone I knew. To get the full effect, I recommand you cd to your Desktop but make sure your Desktop is still visible, so you can see if anything changes. Then try running any of the tree commands: mkdir my_first_dir touch my_first_file.txt echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot; &gt;&gt; my_first_file_with_text.txt","headline":"Navigating your File with bash","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:4000/cli/bash"},"url":"http://localhost:4000/cli/bash"}</script>

<h2 id="knowing-your-way-around-with-bash">Knowing Your Way Around with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code></h2>

<!-- excerpt-start -->

<p>When you first learn bash there are three must learn commands. These are really important commands because they allow you to navigate around your file system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>: <strong>P</strong>rint <strong>W</strong>orking <strong>D</strong>irectory</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>: <strong>C</strong>hange <strong>D</strong>irectory</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>: <strong>L</strong>i<strong>S</strong>t (Contents)</li>
</ul>

<p>An analogy  that I like to use for these commands is imaging you are on a random street in a US city that you donâ€™t know. 
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command is like looking up your current address. It will tell you were you are. 
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command would be like looking around the street (or on your map) to see what restruants are on the street. 
And <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> would be like moving to a new location. 
In keeping with the analogy, you canâ€™t just move to an arbritrary new street because you donâ€™t know this city. 
Instead you have to give precise directions either from where you are currently or relative to some clearly visable space (say a big colorful building you can see from anywhere in the city). 
Now letâ€™s see these in action.</p>

<h3 id="pwd"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code></h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command shows where you are currently located in your filesystem and is equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getwd()</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">os.getcwd()</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code>.
You will notice that in this tutorial, I have all the code as an image instead of code based text that you can copy. 
This was done intentionally because as you first start out, you could be typing these commands in so you get used to them. 
So for each image, you should be typing out the command on your own terminal and confirming you get similar results.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/pwd.png" alt="pwd" /></p>

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/pwd.png" alt="pwd" width="150"/> <br><br> -->

<p>As you can see I am in my users home directory (a special location, and super common, location in your files; on Mac its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/user/USERNAME</code> on linux its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/USERNAME</code>).
This is a super common place, so it has a shortcut that can be accessed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> called the tilde and its above tab and to the left of the 1 on the keyboard.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> can be used to access your home directory (a directory is  just another name for a folder) anywhere on your computer.
Youâ€™ll see more of it later.</p>

<h3 id="ls"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code></h3>

<p>So the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command tells you were you are, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command letâ€™s you look around at the current location, to know what is around you.
So in terms of your filesystem the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command lists all directories and files inside the specified directory (defaults to your current working directory if no directory path is specified). 
I have mine set up to give different colors to folder, which you can ignore for now (at the end of this series I will show you have to customize your terminal to have a fancy terminal as well).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/ls.png" alt="ls" /></p>

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/ls.png" alt="pwd" width="650"/> -->

<h4 id="arugments">Arugments</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command can also take input arguments. Arguments are inputs to a command to adjust its functionality.
In the case of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command you are add a path as an argument, so instead of listing the contents of the current directory, it will list the contents of the specified directory. Lets try it with our downloads folder:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: That unlike most other programming languages, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> does not use parentheses to enclose the arguments. Each on is simply separated by white space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/ls-error.png" alt="ls Error" /></p>

<p>ðŸ˜² Uh-ohh, we got an error, what happened? The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command already  said that we have a downloads folder.
Reading the error it says that there is no downloads folder, but thats weird we just saw it in the previous command, what gives?
Wellâ€¦ this is an important lesson.
All shell commands are <strong>CASE SENSITIVE</strong>.
So, while we have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Downloads</code> folder, we do not have a folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">downloads</code>. That was the problem.
When we correct the case we get this output.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/ls-downloads.png" alt="ls Downloads" /></p>

<p>As you can see, I have a bunch of junk in my downloads folder, which I should probably clean out. But, more importantnly, the command worked now that we made sure that we had the correct case.</p>

<p>To help with the case problem, I personally only used lowercase in my directory and file names. This helps out a lot.
I also avoid spaces in file/directory names because to access them you need to prepend the space with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code>, so if you had a file calle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my first directory</code> you would need to access it with   <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls my\ first\ directory</code>.
So its best to avoid spaces altogether.</p>

<p>Its really important to actually try to impletment these new commands, you will not learn them just by reading this post, you have to actually try them out.
So take a couple mins now to list out the contents of different directories on your computer.</p>

<h4 id="options">Options</h4>

<p>In addition to argumnets commands can also have options.
Options typically change how the output is displayed, compared to arugments, which typically affect what the function is performed on.
One simple example of a command is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -G</code>. Test it out to see what it does.</p>

<p>Options as implied by the name are optional, and tend to either be a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> if the option is a single letter (like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-G</code> example) or two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code> if its a word.</p>

<p>For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls --all</code> (or the shorthand: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -a</code>) shows all files and directories including the hidden files and directories.
A hidden file and a hidden directory are just one that starts with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>.
By default, your OS will hide files and folders starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> when looking for things.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -a</code> will reveal their secrets.
Here, I am showing a git repository that has a few hidden folders that would not have been shown without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code> option nor would they be shown in Finder/Window Explorer.
In this case, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> folder is one example.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/ls-a.png" alt="lsa" />
<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/ls-a.png" alt="pwd" width="650"/> --></p>

<p>There are tons of other useful options for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>. Here are a few noteworthy one.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-l</code> will <strong>L</strong>ong list you files, so it will print out all the metadata as well.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lh</code>will long list them in a <strong>H</strong>uman readable format, so you dont have to convert everything from bytes, it will show you them in eith MB, GB, etc, depending on size.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you can combine these options, so try to guess what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -lha</code> would do, then confirm your hypothesis by running the command.</p>

<h4 id="autocomplete">Autocomplete</h4>

<p>One incredibly useful technique is autocomplete. 
Anytime you are using the terminal (this also works for most other languages as well), you can hit the tab key to autocomplete your command. 
For example, if I wanted to access the contents of the Desktop, I could type the full thing out or I could just type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Desk</code> and press the tab key and it will autocomplete to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Desktop</code>.</p>

<p>Taking autocomplete one step further, you can actually acess use tab to list out the contents. So letâ€™s say, as is the case for me, you have a folder in your Downloads, but you werent quite sure what you called it. You could type out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Dow</code> pres tab to autocomplete to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Downloads/</code> the press tab twice to list out the contents of your folder like this:</p>

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" style="height: 400px">
  <source src="/assets/videos/autocomplete.webm" type="video/webm" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>now you remember that it was called temp so you can type the t and hit autocomplete (or you could just continously hit tab to cycle through the options).
Pretty neat huh, this technique will save you a ton of time, not only because you donâ€™t have to type as much, but also so you donâ€™t accidently swap cases or make a typo.
<strong>Importantly</strong> autocomplete will work on all shell commands (and many other programming langauges as well), so make sure to keep it in mind for the future commands as well.</p>

<p>Now that you know about autocomplete, I want you to take a few more mins listing out the contents of your directories, but also I want you to have side by side the finder window open to the corresponding folder. Notice how much longer it takes to traverse through the contents when using a the GUI compared to the command line. Of course as you improve you are only going to get better, until you are <em>blazingly fast</em>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zsh</code> users you can even type out partial directories and have your shell complete e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd Do/te</code> then hit tab it will give you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd Downloads/temp</code>.</p>

<h3 id="cd"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code></h3>

<p>The counter part <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command, which in the analogy allows you to move from one location to another. 
In your filesystem that means <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command allows you to change your current working directory similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">os.setwd</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">os.chdir()</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/cd.png" alt="cd" /></p>

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/cd.png" alt="cd" width="150"/> -->

<p>As described in the analogy, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command helps us move around in our filesystem.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command showed we were in our home directory, but we used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command just now to move to our Desktop folder.
This is just like if you had Finder or Windows Explore open to that location and move through your files by double clicking the folder icon. 
In fact, now is an excellent time for you to open your files app and place it side by side with your terminal, that way you can see exactly what is happening in both.</p>

<p>With the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command you can specify the location, but like I said in the analogy at the beginnner, you donâ€™t know this place, so you have to give precise directions either from where you currently are (relative path), or from a well known place (absolute path). The well known, highly visisble place in your filesystem is that home directory (or your root directory noted with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>).</p>

<p>Now that we are in the Desktop, you can see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command changes its output to reflect our new current working directory.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/pwd-desktop.png" alt="PWD from Desktop" /></p>

<p>While we are here, of course we can still use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command to see the contents of the Desktop; however, now that we are currently inside the Desktop folder we can no longer just type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Downloads</code>.
Again, this is because we are in the Desktop folder, and the Desktop folder does <strong>NOT</strong> have a Downloads folder.
This would be like clicking the Downloads folder inside of the Desktop folder on the GUI, you canâ€™t because its not there.
So if we want to access the contents of the Downloads folder we have few options.</p>

<p>First, we could simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> back into our home folder. Since the home folder is one folder above the Desktop folder, we could use the shortcut to move up one folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/cd-home.png" alt="CD back up one Directory" /></p>

<p>Alternatively, since we are specifically trying to go to our home folder, we could also use the special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> character with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ~</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/cd-tilde.png" alt="CD back to Home Directory" /></p>

<p>Then once you changed your current working directory you could use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Downloads</code> to access that directories contents.</p>

<p>The other option is to use these techniques along with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command. So we could use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls ../Downloads</code> or ls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls ~/Downloads/</code>.
Personally, I switch back an for depending on my needs.
For example, if I am nested deep inside a folder structure I might just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> but if I am just one folder off I would use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">..</code>.</p>

<p>Now, you should be able to try out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>ing around your different folder (try hidden ones too!) and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> to know where you are and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> to see what is around you.
Try to make sure you are using all the commands and options we talk about so far. Also test out what happens when you do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ../..</code></p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<p>We covered a lot just now, so letâ€™s recap.
You learned how the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> commands can be used to look around you computer.
You also learn how some commands can have arguments to change what they perform their action on, and options which affect how the output is shown.
Finally, you learned about the special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> character to always return home.</p>

<p>First of all, these new skills alone are pretty cool and you should pat yourself on the back for your new skills.
However, I do want to show you one quite new things, just to spark your interest for the next tutorial.
When I saw this in action the first time my mind exploded ðŸ¤¯, and I genuinely tried to show everyone I knew.</p>

<p>To get the full effect, I recommand you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> to your Desktop but make sure your Desktop is still visible, so you can see if anything changes. Then try running any of the tree commands:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir </span>my_first_dir
<span class="nb">touch </span>my_first_file.txt
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, World!"</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> my_first_file_with_text.txt
</code></pre></div></div>
