By the end of this you will know: Basic commands to traverse your computer from the terminal The structure or commands, arguments, and options in bash How to edit, create, move and delete files Create a script to make a folder structure for each new project you are working on. Prerequisites: None; Although it may be helpful to have read through the series intro Knowing Your Way Around with bash When you first learn bash there are three must learn commands. These are really important commands because they allow you to navigate around your file system: pwd: Print Working Directory cd: Change Directory ls: LiSt (Contents) An analogy that I like to use for these commands is imaging you are on a random street in a US city that you don’t know. The pwd command is like looking up your current address. It will tell you were you are. The ls command would be like looking around the street (or on your map) to see what restruants are on the street. And cd would be like moving to a new location. In keeping with the analogy, you can’t just move to an arbritrary new street because you don’t know this city. Instead you have to give precise directions either from where you are currently or relative to some clearly visable space (say a big colorful building you can see from anywhere in the city). Now let’s see these in action. pwd The pwd command shows where you are currently located in your filesystem and is equivalent to getwd() in R or os.getcwd() in python. For this tutorial series, all the commands that I typed out will be preceeded by a ➜ and the output will be preceeded by a #. ➜ pwd # /user/deshawn As you can see I am in my users home directory (a special location, and super common, location in your files; on Mac its /user/USERNAME on linux its /home/USERNAME). This is a super common place, so it has a shortcut that can be accessed with ~ called the tilde and its above tab and to the left of the 1 on the keyboard. The ~ can be used to access your home directory (a directory is just another name for a folder) anywhere on your computer. You’ll see more of it later. Hint: Capitalization matters so make sure you keep that in mind. I personally always have my folders named with lowercase letters to make this easier. Simlarly, spaces require an espace \, so I also avoid spaces in directory names (typically using _’s). ls So the pwd command tells you were you are, the ls command let’s you look around at the current location, to know what is around you. So in terms of your filesystem the ls command lists all directories and files inside the specified directory (defaults to your current working directory if no directory path is specified). I have mine set up to give different colors to folder, which you can ignore for now (at the end of this series I will show you have to customize your terminal to have a fancy terminal as well). ➜ ls # bin Documents gems Music Public Templates workshop # Desktop Downloads git_repos Pictures R Videos Arugments The ls command can also take input arguments. Arguments are inputs to a command to adjust its functionality. In the case of the ls command you are add a path as an argument, so instead of listing the contents of the current directory, it will list the contents of the specified directory. Lets try it with our downloads folder: Note: That unlike most other programming languages, bash does not use parentheses to enclose the arguments. Each on is simply separated by white space. ➜ ls # ls: downloads: No such file or directory (os error 2). Uh-ohh, we got an error, what happened? The ls command already said that we have a downloads folder. Well… this is an important lesson. All shell commands are case sensitive. So, while we have a Downloads folder, we do not have a folder called downloads. That was the problem. When we correct the case we get this output. As you can see, I have a bunch of junk in my downloads folder, which I should probably clean out. But, more importantnly, the command worked now that we made sure that we had the correct case. To help with the case problem, I personally only used lowercase in my directory and file names. This helps out a lot. I also avoid spaces in file/directory names because to access them you need to prepend the space with a \, so if you had a file calle my first directory you would need to access it with ls my\ first\ directory. So its best to avoid spaces altogether. Its really important to actually try to impletment this new commands, you will not learn them just by reading this post, you have to actually try them out. So take a couple mins now to list out the contents of different directories on your computer. Options Just like the cd command, the ls command can also take input arguments, if you wanted to see the contents of a folder you were not currently in. Additionally, you can use differnt options with the ls command. These options are specified with a - when its a single letter or -- when its a word. For example, ls -a (a for all) shows all hidden files and directories in addition to the nonhidden ones. A hidden file and a hidden direcotry are just one that starts with a .. By default, your OS will hide files and folders starting with . when looking for things. The ls -a will reveal their secrets. In out case, the .git folder is one example. Autocomplete One incredibly useful technique is autocomplete. Anytime you are using the terminal (this also works for most other languages as well), you can hit the tab key to autocomplete your command. For example, if I wanted to access the contents of the Desktop, I could type the full thing out or I could just type ls Desk and press the tab key and it will autocomplete to ls Desktop. Taking autocomplete one step further, you can actually acess use tab to list out the contents. So let’s say, as is the case for me, you have a folder in your Downloads, but you werent quite sure what you called it. You could type out ls Dow pres tab to autocomplete to ls Downloads/ the press tab twice to list out the contents of your folder like this: Your browser does not support the video tag. now you remember that it was called temp so you can type the t and hit autocomplete (or you could just continously hit tab to cycle through the options). Pretty neat huh, this technique will save you a ton of time, not only because you don’t have to type as much, but also so you don’t accidently swap cases or make a typo. Now that you know about autocomplete, I want you to take a few more mins listing out the contents of your directories, but also I want you to have side by side the finder window open to the corresponding folder. Notice how much longer it takes to traverse through the contents when using a the GUI compared to the command line. Of course as you improve you are only going to get better, until you are blazingly fast! Hint: For zsh users you can even type out partial directories and have your shell complete e.g., cd Do/te then hit tab it will give you cd Downloads/temp. cd The counter part pwd is the cd command, which in the analogy allows you to move from one location to another. In your filesystem that means cd command allows you to change your current working directory similar to os.setwd in R and os.chdir() in python. Unlike most programming languages you are might be familiar with, in bash you The arguments are just placed after the command separated by a space. For more info about the structure of bash scripting see below ~ cd Desktop ~/Desktop As described in the analogy, the cd command helps us move around in our filesystem. The pwd command showed we were in our home directory, but we used the cd command just now to move to our Desktop folder. This is just like if you had Finder or Windows Explore open to that location and move through your files by double clicking the folder icon. With the cd command you can specify the location, but like I said in the analogy at the beginnner, you don’t know this place, so you have to give direction either from where you currently are, or from a well known plce. The well known, highly visisble place in your filesystem is that home directory. Try cding around to other common locations like the Downloads folder The next command will help us look around, so I would recommend you adding a Building your knowledge I need to at least have them make a document and probably a folder, perhaps give them the sense of jubulation from when you see a folder get created on your desktop. They probably neeed to edit a file but that does feel like a lot. TBD Beginning to think we need a part 1 and part 2 cuz its not enough to shotgun a crap ton of commands at the end Also they need a lot more than this If I make a part 2 I need to switch the link in the form of a command to be the new page link instead. I just want to end you with a little spark. This was the moment I got hooked. When I was able to make something on my computer without clicking a button. My mind was astounded. Looked at the list again, I will be adding the mkdir touch, and mv because they get to show some neatness Probs also cp Def not rm, this will be a explore on your own kinda thing with warning attached. –&gt; Homework Try to make a new folder called git_repos somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. Then make README.md file (for advanced users try nano or vim to edit it and say something). Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure: my_first_bash_script/ |-- analyses/ |-- plots/ |-- expriment/ |-- data/ |-- lit_review/ |-- supporting_docs/ |-- scales/ |-- irb_docs/ |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md |-- README.md Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. I highly highly reccommend two separate .md files. The README is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). In contrast the DEVELOPMENT file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project. Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable." />

Unlike most programming languages you are might be familiar with, in bash you The arguments are just placed after the command separated by a space. For more info about the structure of bash scripting see below ~ cd Desktop ~/Desktop As described in the analogy, the cd command helps us move around in our filesystem. The pwd command showed we were in our home directory, but we used the cd command just now to move to our Desktop folder. This is just like if you had Finder or Windows Explore open to that location and move through your files by double clicking the folder icon. With the cd command you can specify the location, but like I said in the analogy at the beginnner, you don’t know this place, so you have to give direction either from where you currently are, or from a well known plce. The well known, highly visisble place in your filesystem is that home directory. Try cding around to other common locations like the Downloads folder The next command will help us look around, so I would recommend you adding a Building your knowledge I need to at least have them make a document and probably a folder, perhaps give them the sense of jubulation from when you see a folder get created on your desktop. They probably neeed to edit a file but that does feel like a lot. TBD Beginning to think we need a part 1 and part 2 cuz its not enough to shotgun a crap ton of commands at the end Also they need a lot more than this If I make a part 2 I need to switch the link in the form of a command to be the new page link instead. I just want to end you with a little spark. This was the moment I got hooked. When I was able to make something on my computer without clicking a button. My mind was astounded. Looked at the list again, I will be adding the mkdir touch, and mv because they get to show some neatness Probs also cp Def not rm, this will be a explore on your own kinda thing with warning attached. –&gt; Homework Try to make a new folder called git_repos somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. Then make README.md file (for advanced users try nano or vim to edit it and say something). Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure: my_first_bash_script/ |-- analyses/ |-- plots/ |-- expriment/ |-- data/ |-- lit_review/ |-- supporting_docs/ |-- scales/ |-- irb_docs/ |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md |-- README.md Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. I highly highly reccommend two separate .md files. The README is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). In contrast the DEVELOPMENT file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project. Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable.","headline":"Bash em, I don’t even know em","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:4000/cli/bash"},"url":"http://localhost:4000/cli/bash"}</script>

<h2 id="knowing-your-way-around-with-bash">Knowing Your Way Around with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code></h2>

<!-- excerpt-start -->

<p>When you first learn bash there are three must learn commands. These are really important commands because they allow you to navigate around your file system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>: <strong>P</strong>rint <strong>W</strong>orking <strong>D</strong>irectory</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>: <strong>C</strong>hange <strong>D</strong>irectory</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>: <strong>L</strong>i<strong>S</strong>t (Contents)</li>
</ul>

<p>An analogy  that I like to use for these commands is imaging you are on a random street in a US city that you don’t know. 
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command is like looking up your current address. It will tell you were you are. 
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command would be like looking around the street (or on your map) to see what restruants are on the street. 
And <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> would be like moving to a new location. 
In keeping with the analogy, you can’t just move to an arbritrary new street because you don’t know this city. 
Instead you have to give precise directions either from where you are currently or relative to some clearly visable space (say a big colorful building you can see from anywhere in the city). 
Now let’s see these in action.</p>

<h3 id="pwd"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code></h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command shows where you are currently located in your filesystem and is equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getwd()</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">os.getcwd()</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code>. For this tutorial series, all the commands that I typed out will be preceeded by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">➜</code> and the output will be preceeded by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>➜ <span class="nb">pwd</span> 
<span class="c"># /user/deshawn</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/assets/imgs/pwd.png" alt="pwd" /></p>

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/pwd.png" alt="pwd" width="150"/> <br><br> -->

<p>As you can see I am in my users home directory (a special location, and super common, location in your files; on Mac its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/user/USERNAME</code> on linux its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/USERNAME</code>).
This is a super common place, so it has a shortcut that can be accessed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> called the tilde and its above tab and to the left of the 1 on the keyboard.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> can be used to access your home directory (a directory is  just another name for a folder) anywhere on your computer.
You’ll see more of it later.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: Capitalization matters so make sure you keep that in mind. 
I personally always have my folders named with lowercase letters to make this easier. 
Simlarly, spaces require an espace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code>, so I also avoid spaces in directory names (typically using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code>’s).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ls"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code></h3>

<p>So the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command tells you were you are, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command let’s you look around at the current location, to know what is around you.
So in terms of your filesystem the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command lists all directories and files inside the specified directory (defaults to your current working directory if no directory path is specified). 
I have mine set up to give different colors to folder, which you can ignore for now (at the end of this series I will show you have to customize your terminal to have a fancy terminal as well).</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>➜  <span class="nb">ls</span> 
<span class="c"># bin      Documents  gems       Music     Public  Templates  workshop</span>
<span class="c"># Desktop  Downloads  git_repos  Pictures  R       Videos   </span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/ls.png" alt="ls" /></p>

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/ls.png" alt="pwd" width="650"/> -->

<h4 id="arugments">Arugments</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command can also take input arguments. Arguments are inputs to a command to adjust its functionality.
In the case of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command you are add a path as an argument, so instead of listing the contents of the current directory, it will list the contents of the specified directory. Lets try it with our downloads folder:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: That unlike most other programming languages, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> does not use parentheses to enclose the arguments. Each on is simply separated by white space.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>➜  <span class="nb">ls</span> 
<span class="c"># ls: downloads: No such file or directory (os error 2).</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/ls-error.png" alt="ls Error" /></p>

<p>Uh-ohh, we got an error, what happened? The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command already  said that we have a downloads folder.
Well… this is an important lesson.
All shell commands are <strong>case sensitive</strong>.
So, while we have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Downloads</code> folder, we do not have a folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">downloads</code>. That was the problem.
When we correct the case we get this output.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/ls-downloads.png" alt="ls Downloads" /></p>

<p>As you can see, I have a bunch of junk in my downloads folder, which I should probably clean out. But, more importantnly, the command worked now that we made sure that we had the correct case.</p>

<p>To help with the case problem, I personally only used lowercase in my directory and file names. This helps out a lot.
I also avoid spaces in file/directory names because to access them you need to prepend the space with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code>, so if you had a file calle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my first directory</code> you would need to access it with   <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls my\ first\ directory</code>.
So its best to avoid spaces altogether.</p>

<p>Its really important to actually try to impletment this new commands, you will not learn them just by reading this post, you have to actually try them out.
So take a couple mins now to list out the contents of different directories on your computer.</p>

<h4 id="options">Options</h4>

<p>Just like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command can also take input arguments, if you wanted to see the contents of a folder you were not currently in.
Additionally, you can use differnt options with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command.
These options are specified with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> when its a single letter or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code> when its a word.</p>

<p>For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -a</code> (a for all) shows all hidden files and directories in addition to the nonhidden ones. 
A hidden file and a hidden direcotry are just one that starts with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>.
By default, your OS will hide files and folders starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> when looking for things.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -a</code> will reveal their secrets.
In out case, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> folder is one example.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/ls-a.png" alt="lsa" />
<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/ls-a.png" alt="pwd" width="650"/> --></p>

<h4 id="autocomplete">Autocomplete</h4>

<p>One incredibly useful technique is autocomplete. 
Anytime you are using the terminal (this also works for most other languages as well), you can hit the tab key to autocomplete your command. 
For example, if I wanted to access the contents of the Desktop, I could type the full thing out or I could just type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Desk</code> and press the tab key and it will autocomplete to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Desktop</code>.</p>

<p>Taking autocomplete one step further, you can actually acess use tab to list out the contents. So let’s say, as is the case for me, you have a folder in your Downloads, but you werent quite sure what you called it. You could type out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Dow</code> pres tab to autocomplete to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls Downloads/</code> the press tab twice to list out the contents of your folder like this:</p>

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" style="height: 400px">
  <source src="/assets/videos/autocomplete.webm" type="video/webm" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>now you remember that it was called temp so you can type the t and hit autocomplete (or you could just continously hit tab to cycle through the options).
Pretty neat huh, this technique will save you a ton of time, not only because you don’t have to type as much, but also so you don’t accidently swap cases or make a typo.</p>

<p>Now that you know about autocomplete, I want you to take a few more mins listing out the contents of your directories, but also I want you to have side by side the finder window open to the corresponding folder. Notice how much longer it takes to traverse through the contents when using a the GUI compared to the command line. Of course as you improve you are only going to get better, until you are <em>blazingly fast</em>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zsh</code> users you can even type out partial directories and have your shell complete e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd Do/te</code> then hit tab it will give you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd Downloads/temp</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="cd"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code></h3>

<p>The counter part <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command, which in the analogy allows you to move from one location to another. 
In your filesystem that means <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command allows you to change your current working directory similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">os.setwd</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">os.chdir()</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code>.
Unlike most programming languages you are might be familiar with, in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> you 
The arguments are just placed after the command separated by a space. 
For more info about the structure of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> scripting <a href="#the-form-of-commands" title="The Structure of a Bash Command">see below</a></p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~ <span class="nb">cd </span>Desktop
~/Desktop
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/cd.png" alt="cd" /></p>

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/cd.png" alt="cd" width="150"/> -->

<p>As described in the analogy, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command helps us move around in our filesystem.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command showed we were in our home directory, but we used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command just now to move to our Desktop folder.
This is just like if you had Finder or Windows Explore open to that location and move through your files by double clicking the folder icon.</p>

<p>With the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command you can specify the location, but like I said in the analogy at the beginnner, you don’t know this place, so you have to give direction either from where you currently are, or from a well known plce. The well known, highly visisble place in your filesystem is that home directory.</p>

<p>Try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>ing around to other common locations like the Downloads folder</p>

<p>The next command will help us look around, so I would recommend you adding a</p>

<p>I need to at least have them make a document and probably a folder, perhaps give them the sense of jubulation from when you see a folder get created on your desktop.</p>

<p>They probably neeed to edit a file but that does feel like a lot. TBD</p>

<p>Beginning to think we need a part 1 and part 2 cuz its not enough to shotgun a crap ton of commands at the end
Also they need a lot more than this</p>

<p>If I make a part 2 I need to switch the link in the form of a command to be the new page link instead.</p>

<p>I just want to end you with a little spark. This was the moment I got hooked. When I was able to make something on my computer without clicking a button. 
My mind was astounded.</p>

<p>Looked at the list again, I will be adding the mkdir touch, and mv because they get to show some neatness
Probs also cp</p>

<p>Def not rm, this will be a explore on your own kinda thing with warning attached.

<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>

<p>Try to make a new folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git_repos</code> somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. 
Then make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file (for advanced users try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> to edit it and say something).</p>

<p>Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). 
Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>my_first_bash_script/
  |-- analyses/
      |-- plots/
  |-- expriment/
      |-- data/
  |-- lit_review/
  |-- supporting_docs/
      |-- scales/
      |-- irb_docs/  
  |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md
  |-- README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. 
I highly highly reccommend two separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> files. 
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code> is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). 
In contrast the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEVELOPMENT</code> file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project.
Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. 
I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. 
This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable.</p>
