Specifically you will learn: How to make a bash script (Setting a language with Shebang #!; Changing permissions chmod) Taking in arguments/user input for your script Change your $PATH to run scripts anywhere What is .bashrc / .zshrc Prerequisites: Knowledge of basic shell commands Read through the Command line (Bash/Zsh) What is a Variable Up until now, I have only tagentially mentioned the concept of a variable. A variable is a part of your script that can change either from user input or come other parts of your script. Variables are a foundational part of any programmers toolkit because they allow you to write code that is adaptable to the use case instead of having to know all of the details before the project starts. In the previous post we used the $1 variable to represent the first argument with the command. We did not know in advance what is was going to be, but we just knew we wanted to print it out. Additionally, we use the read command to read input from the user and store that as a variable to be used later on in the script. So you already have a sense of how variables can be used. Here, I am just going to spell out some good practices with variables. For example, typically you want to always create/assign all your variables at the top of your script. There are some exceptions, but in general, you should try to stick to this rule. It helps make your code much more readable and editable in the future so its good to get in the habit early. Another type is if you assign it once, and dont expect it to ever change, then you typically use all caps (using underscores instead of dashes). In contrast, if its a variable that you expect to change a few times or only lives inside a fucntion, then it can be lower case. This is not set in stone, but again its a good practice to have in all languages. For more best tips on general good practices I will be making one in the future, but until then you can check out Googles Shell Style Guide. When defining a variable in your script you will need to know a few things. To define a variable you need to use the following structure: VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE Importantly, there should be no spaces before and after the =. Once you have a variable stored, you can use it anywhere in the script. All you need to do is use the $ before the variable name. For example, $VARIABLE_NAME. Environment Variables Environment Variables are a special type of variable that are always accessible. That are available in every script on your computer and can even be used from the command line. To set an environment variable you can use the export command. For example, you can set your name as an environment variable with the following command: export NAME=Deshawn You can see a list of all of your environment variables with the env command. I have a lot of environment variables, so I won’t show my output, but there is one in particular that you should note. That is the $PATH variable. What is the $PATH variable and how to we adjust it The PATH environmnet variable is a special one. This variable tells you computer where to look for terminal commands. So your computer will look at each folder to find the command you try to use. If it does not find the command in that folder it will continue to the next until it finishes teh full path. By default your path is: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin. Each of the colons :, signifies a different directory. So when looking for a command it will first search in /usr/bin then move to bin if that is unsuccessful and so forth. It is very common practice to edit your PATH to allow you to have access to other commands regardless of what directory you are in. Here is my PATH: Just like you saw previously, you can use the export command to change your PATH. For example, you can add the first_folder to the beginning of the PATH with: export PATH=&quot;$HOME/Documents/first_folder/:$PATH&quot; This command will adjust your PATH to move the first_folder in the beginning of your PATH before it searches any other folder. Note I use the HOME environment variable so I dont have to type out /home/buddy, then after the folder name I use a : to separate the next folder in the sequence. Then I add the PATH variable again at the end. This allows you to keep the old PATH at the end without removing it. It would mess up your whole system if that were to happen. In case you ever do mess up your path you can always use this to reset it. Here I don’t include the PATH variable because I am resetting it entirely. export PATH=&quot;/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin&quot; One thing you will probably notice, is that anything you export only lasts as long as you have the terminal open. If you close it everything resets. To solve this, you can adjust your .bashrc or .zshrc. What is the .bashrc/.zshrc and why do I need to know it One final thing to note, is the that when assigning an environmental variable with export, it will only last for that session. If you open a new tab/window or if you close this one and open a new one, you will not longer have access to that environment variable. This is where you .bashrc or .zshrc come into play. These files are run everytime you open up a new terminal, so if you add the export command to your rc file, it will be available everytime you open up a new terminal/tab. Its important you know what shell you are using to know which file you need to edit because you might have both. To check you default shell you use, you can run either of the following commands: echo $0 echo $SHELL Once you know which shell you are using, you will need to find the file. They are both located in your home directory, so for bash its located at ~/.bashrc. The zsh one is located at ~/.zshrc. Note the . since these are hidden files. Add the relevant export to the end of this file (you learned about appending with echo or editing with nano)." />

<h2 id="what-is-a-variable">What is a Variable</h2>

<p>Up until now, I have only tagentially mentioned the concept of a variable.
A variable is a part of your script that can change either from user input or come other parts of your script.
Variables are a foundational part of any programmers toolkit because they allow you to write code that is adaptable to the use case instead of having to know all of the details before the project starts.</p>

<p>In the previous post we used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$1</code> variable to represent the first argument with the command.
We did not know in advance what is was going to be, but we just knew we wanted to print it out. 
Additionally, we use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read</code> command to read input from the user and store that as a variable to be used later on in the script.
So you already have a sense of how variables can be used.
Here, I am just going to spell out some good practices with variables.</p>

<p>For example, typically you want to always create/assign all your variables at the top of your script. 
There are some exceptions, but in general, you should try to stick to this rule.
It helps make your code much more readable and editable in the future so its good to get in the habit early.
Another type is if you assign it once, and dont expect it to ever change, then you typically use all caps (using underscores instead of dashes).
In contrast, if its a variable that you expect to change a few times or only lives inside a fucntion, then it can be lower case.
This is not set in stone, but again its a good practice to have in all languages.
For more best tips on general good practices I will be making one in the future, but until then you can check out <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html" title="Google Shell Style Guide">Googles Shell Style Guide</a>.</p>

<p>When defining a variable in your script you will need to know a few things. 
To define a variable you need to use the following structure:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">VARIABLE_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span>VALUE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Importantly, there should be no spaces before and after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>.
Once you have a variable stored, you can use it anywhere in the script.
All you need to do is use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> before the variable name. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$VARIABLE_NAME</code>.</p>

<h3 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h3>

<p>Environment Variables are a special type of variable that are always accessible.
That are available in every script on your computer and can even be used from the command line.
To set an environment variable you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code> command.
For example, you can set your name as an environment variable with the following command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">NAME</span><span class="o">=</span>Deshawn
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see a list of all of your environment variables with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env</code> command.
I have a lot of environment variables, so I won’t show my output, but there is one in particular that you should note.
That is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$PATH</code> variable.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-path-variable-and-how-to-we-adjust-it">What is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$PATH</code> variable and how to we adjust it</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> environmnet variable is a special one.
This variable tells you computer where to look for terminal commands.
So your computer will look at each folder to find the command you try to use.
If it does not find the command in that folder it will continue to the next until it finishes teh full path.</p>

<p>By default your path is: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin</code>.
Each of the colons <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:</code>, signifies a different directory.
So when looking for a command it will first search in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin</code> then move to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code> if that is unsuccessful and so forth.</p>

<p>It is very common practice to edit your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> to allow you to have access to other commands regardless of what directory you are in.
Here is my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/path.png" alt="My Path" /></p>

<p>Just like you saw previously, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code> command to change your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code>.
For example, you can add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first_folder</code> to the beginning of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> with:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span><span class="s2">/Documents/first_folder/:</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command will adjust your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> to move the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first_folder</code> in the beginning of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> before it searches any other folder.
Note I use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HOME</code> environment variable so I dont have to type out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/buddy</code>, then after the folder name I use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:</code> to separate the next folder in the sequence.
Then I add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> variable again at the end.
This allows you to keep the old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> at the end without removing it.
It would mess up your whole system if that were to happen.
In case you ever do mess up your path you can always use this to reset it.
Here I don’t include the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> variable because I am resetting it entirely.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing you will probably notice, is that anything you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code> only lasts as long as you have the terminal open.
If you close it everything resets.
To solve this, you can adjust your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zshrc</code>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-bashrczshrc-and-why-do-i-need-to-know-it">What is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zshrc</code> and why do I need to know it</h2>

<p>One final thing to note, is the that when assigning an environmental variable with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code>, it will only last for that session.
If you open a new tab/window or if you close this one and open a new one, you will not longer have access to that environment variable.
This is where you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zshrc</code> come into play.
These files are run everytime you open up a new terminal, so if you add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code> command to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rc</code> file, it will be available everytime you open up a new terminal/tab.</p>

<p>Its important you know what shell you are using to know which file you need to edit because you might have both.
To check you default shell you use, you can run either of the following commands:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$0</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$SHELL</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you know which shell you are using, you will need to find the file.
They are both located in your home directory, so for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> its located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.bashrc</code>.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zsh</code> one is located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.zshrc</code>.
Note the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> since these are hidden files.
Add the relevant export to the end of this file (you learned about appending with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> or editing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code>).</p>
