<section class="takeaways">

  <p>In this blog you will learn basic bash commands. By the end of this you will know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Basic commands to traverse your computer from the terminal</li>
    <li>The structure or commands, arguments, and options in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code></li>
    <li>How to edit, create, move and delete files</li>
    <li>Create a script to make a folder structure for each new project you are working on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Prerequisites:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Have read through the previous post on <a href="/cli/bash">bash</a> or have a general understanding of how to move around in bash</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<h2 id="building-your-knowledge">Building your Knowledge</h2>

<!-- excerpt-start -->

<p>After you have gone through the last section its time to remove the training wheels.
To learn to code, you need</p>
<ol>
  <li>to try to implement the skills that you have learned and</li>
  <li>the space to come up with creative solutions to your problems.</li>
</ol>

<p>So my goal is to motivate you by showing you fun useful ideas/commands to spark your creativity to inspire you to create something.
I just want to scaffold you just enough so that you can figure things out on your own and solve problems that are important/useful to you.
The best way to learn is for you to come up with creative ways to combine the commands I showed you and others that I did not, to solve problems that are unique to you.
So going into explicit details on all the commands would only slow you down because I would inevitably end up teaching you a lot of commands that are not useful for your problems.
To that end, I am intentionally not going to list through all the commands and explain them in great detail like I did before because that is just not a good way to learn how to code.
Instead, throughout this post I will:
<!-- excerpt-end --></p>
<ul>
  <li>Show you how to view and edit files</li>
  <li>Show the general structure of shell commands</li>
  <li>Show you how to find and learn about new commands</li>
  <li>List off a bunch of commands that are generally good to know (without much details so you can pick and choose which are worth you exploring further)</li>
  <li>Finally end off with some examples to inspire you to create your own projects</li>
</ul>

<p>here we will start of form and then go list usefule commands</p>

<p>enough to be dangerous</p>

<h2 id="editing-files">Editing Files</h2>

<p>I left off the last post by hinting and some really neat commands that were centered around creating files and directories.
To quickly recap, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> command <strong>M</strong>a<strong>K</strong>es a <strong>DIR</strong>ectory, you can even append the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> (for parent) option to make multiple nested directories.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch</code> command creates an empty file.
With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> you can make a file that contains text with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo "SOME TEXT" &gt; file_name</code>, note the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>.
If you have a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> it will delete all the contents are replace it wil the text, if you include two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;</code>, then you will simply append the text to the file.
To remember the arrow direction, I think of it like funneling a lot of text into a file, so from big to little.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to make a file, lets learn how to edit a file from the terminal.
There are a lot of options to edit files <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vi</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvim</code> (my preferred option), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emacs</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code>.
Nano is by far and away the easiest place to start for beginners, so I will cover a few things with it.</p>

<p>Again, like the rest of this post, this is just a taste of how to edit file, and with these skills you will be able to make some changes, but will not be super efficient.
For that you will have to do some extra learning on your own.
I personally use neovim, which notably has a steep learning curve, but is <em>blazingly fast</em>.
So fast, I even replace my normal IDE (Visual Studio Code for it).
If you are interested, I would recommend you check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen" title="The Primeagen YT">The Primeagen</a>.
He is a software developer for Netflex that has some amazing videos on <a href="https://youtu.be/H3o4l4GVLW0" title="Primeagen Vim Playlist">vim/neovim</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, with that out of the way lets edit some files!
First, to get some more practice make a new folder in your Documents folder (or you Desktop if you prefer to see it) and inside that use one of the two methods above to make a blank file.
You can of course make a file with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code>, but this is just good practice.</p>

<p>To open up the file to edit, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> and then the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PATH_TO_THE_FILE</code> you wish to edit.
Keep in mind it will depend on your current working directory, so if your current directory is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/users/Deshawn</code> and your file is in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Documents/first_folder/my-text.txt</code> then you will need to type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano ~/Documents/first_folder/my-text.txt</code>, but if you already <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>‘d into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first_folder</code> directory, then you can simply type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano my-text.txt</code>.</p>

<p>When you first open nano it should look something liket this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/nano.png" alt="Nano" /></p>

<p>At the top center, you can see the current files name.
At the bottom, you see a list of keyboard shortcuts, and just above that you see how many lines were read in (0 in my case because it was an empty file).</p>

<p>From there, you are free to type as you go, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> does not allow for mouse movement, though so you need to use the arrow keys to get around (which is partially why its much slower that other editors).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For vi/vim/nvim you move around with the keyboard but in a much faster way, because you use the whol keyboard, but it means you need to tell it when you want to insert text vs move around really fast. This plus needing a command to save and close a file, people tend to get stuck in these 😂. But again, after that steep learning curve it is really nice, for those who like a challange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To close a file, you want to do two things, first you need to save the changes, and then close the file.
Take a look at the bottom command shortcuts if you ever get confused.
First you need to save the file, in a lot of older editors they use the term writing the file. 
So in this case, to save, you just hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O</code>, where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> means the Control key on your keyboard, usually the fall left corner. And the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O</code> is the letter not the number (you don’t need the shift key even though it displays in as a capital letter).
Once you hit that key combo, you will be prompted to save with the same name (just hit enter) or a new name (type out the changed name):
You typically just hit enter here, unless you have reason not too.</p>

<!--
Once you hit that key combo, you will be prompted to save the file and overwrite the previous contents `y` for yes and `n` for no:
![Nano Saving](/assets/imgs/nano-save.png)
-->

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/nano-name.png" alt="Nano Changing Name" /></p>

<p>Finnaly, you can exit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> as shown in the bottom that is with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>, which again is the Control key and the letter.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You just edited your first file straight from the terminal. You can check out the contents of the file with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> command, include the filename as the argument.</p>

## Building your Knowledge

I need to at least have them make a document and probably a folder, perhaps give them the sense of jubulation from when you see a folder get created on your desktop. 

I just want to end you with a little spark. This was the moment I got hooked. When I was able to make something on my computer without clicking a button. 
My mind was astounded.

<h2 id="learn-new-commands">Learn New Commands</h2>

<p>By this point, you should have a solid foundation for the command line.
You can move around (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>), look around (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>), make/change things (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code>).
All you need now is to find some more commands that would be helpful for you.
So, I am going to show you some extra commands that specifically help you find other commands and learn how they work.</p>

<p>These commands are more important to remember because they let you find a command to do perform and action as well as learn how to use that command:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apropos</code>: à propos (meaning with regard to). This command allows you to search for all commands the perform function/have anything in their name/description about a topic. It takes one argument which is the description that you wish to use to search. Example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apropos day</code> will show you every command that has day in the title or description</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>If you only remember one command this is the one to remember</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code>: (Pull up the) Manual (for the respective command so you can learn all the options available). This takes a single argument, which is the command you want to pull up the man pages for (similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help()</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">??</code> in most languages). Example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man ls</code> show you a description of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command and all the options available.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tldr</code>: Sometimes when you are first learning to code, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code> pages are a bit overwhelming because that have more technical language and generally more info than you need. That is where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tldr</code> comes in. This is a series of <strong>T</strong>oo <strong>L</strong>ong; <strong>D</strong>idn’t <strong>R</strong>ead snippets to replace the lengthy manpages. This is not available by default, but as per usual, you can install these with your favorite <a href="/future-links">package manager</a>. Example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tldr ls</code>:</p>

<p>Of course if you are still struggling either with understanding the command or finding a command to do a particular thing, do a quick search online or phone a friend!</p>

<h2 id="the-form-of-commands">The form of Commands</h2>

<p>By this point, you probably have a good intuitive sense of the structure of commands, so feel free to skip to the <a href="creatingdeleting-folder-and-files">list</a></p>

<p>A command is just a mini program that executes when you call it from  a terminal. 
Every command has 3 basic (potential) parts. 
The command itself, any options you can apply, and finally any arguments.</p>

<p>As you saw in the previous section with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command, we had an argument (the new directory to change to). 
Again the argument is separated only by a space (no parentheses as you may be used to from other programming languages) and any additional arugments are also separated by a space. 
Meaning, if you have an argument that includes a space you either need to surround it in quotes or use the escape character <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls my\ folder\ with\ spaces</code>).
Occasionally, you will find some commands that use named arguments in which case the argument requires you use the option syntax in front of the argumnet.
For the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command we learned about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code> option again separated by a space. Options in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> start with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code>. 
It is common practice for single letter options to have a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> and full word arguments have two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code>.</p>

<p>Now that you know how commands are structure the next couple sections will list a bunch of useful basic commands before we end by showing you a way to learn the ins and outs of a command (like its options) and how to find a comand to perform a task you suspect exists.</p>

<h3 id="creatingdeleting-folders-and-files">Creating/Deleting Folders and Files</h3>

<p>Before continuing, try each of the following commands out, just to you know how they work.</p>

<p>For all the commands the relevant arguments will be in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code>: Make Directory (folder) [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_folder_to_make</code>; use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> (for make parent directories) if you want to make multiple nested folders simultaneously]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch</code>: Make an Empty File [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_make</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code>: Copy [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_copy</code>; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_location_to_copy_to</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code>: Move [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_move</code>; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_location_to_move_to</code>; can also be used to change a files name if you move it to the same location with a new name]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code>: Remove a file [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_remove</code>]</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="viewing-contents-and-editing-files">Viewing Contents and Editing Files</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code>: A simple to use text editor. You will likely hear about other editors like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emacs</code>. Both are really good, but they have a really hard learning curve, so I don’t reccomend them when you start out. I personally use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvim</code>, which is a modern replacement for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code>. [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_edit</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code>: Concatenate (prints out files contents) [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_print</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code>: Less (is more… powerful). Useful for printing out really long docs becuse you can scroll through them [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_print</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">more</code>: More (of the content on screen) Useful for printing out really long docs but not as good as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code> [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_print</code>]</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="additional-commands">Additional Commands</h3>

<p>These are some more commands that are either super useful or are just really neat!
All commands that are not installed by default will have a link to download, but of course they can also be downloaded from your favorite <a href="/future-links">package manager</a>.
They default to the homebrew package manager if a general download link is not available, so feel free to swtich to your preferred one.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> both are used to access websites from the command line</li>
  <li><a href="https://brew.sh/" title="Homebrew"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code></a> is a <a href="/future-links">package manager</a> for MacOS that allows you to download pretty much any app from your terminal</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alias</code> to make long command shorted, but making your own alternative command name</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> find every file and the specific line number that [“SOME RANDOM TEXT”] appears</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> can be used to replace text in a file. Really helpful in combination with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cal</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> give you a calendar and the date, respectively</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> gets the word count of a file (note, I dont think this works on .docpx files)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">which</code> shows you were a command lives on your system</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code> to get your ip address</li>
  <li><a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/netcat#default" title="Netcat"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netcat</code></a> for all things networking</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ufw</code> setting up a firewall</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> allows you to access another computer</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo</code> allows you run as super user, essentailly having complete access. You will learn more about this command later</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix" title="C the Matrix"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmatrix</code></a> to look like you a hacker in the matrix</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">top</code>, <a href="https://github.com/htop-dev/htop#prerequisite" title="Htop sys monitoring"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">htop</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/btop#installation" title="BTop sys monitoring"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">btop</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/btop#installation" title="Gtop Sys monitoring"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gtop</code></a> etc. are all different programs to monitor your system</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki/Installation" title="Neofetch to look kool"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neofetch</code></a> just looks super kool</li>
  <li><a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/telnet#default" title="Telnet"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl</code></a> watch an ascii based replication of star wars (no sound, but still super fun)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli#install" title="Ani-Cli"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ani-cli</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/whoisYoges/anime-terminal#anime-terminal" title="Anime-Terminal fork of Ani-Cli"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anime-terminal</code></a> allow you to stream or download full fledge anime from the terminal and even save your watch history</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, the last 4 require you to install them via either your <a href="/future-links">package manager</a> or from github directly</p>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p>of course we only touched the surface here, I only really showed you commands that allow you to navigate your file systems, but there are loads other commands as well. For example, there are command to access content from the internet <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> commands that lets you access other computers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vlc</code>. My goal here was not have a complete bash tutorial, but rather to get you to a position where you can be dangers and importantly, hopefully show you just enough to spark your ideas on how valuable this is. The next step is for you to apply this knowledge. Make some small app that automates away boring things you have to do all the time. You might not now all the commands necessary to complete the task, but that is ok, you can google a command or better yet, try to search for it with apropos.</p>

<p>Some examples my RAs have done in the past include:</p>

<p>If you are looking for a place to spruce up your terminal, you can check out the modern unix project, where they attempt to update all the old commands to fit the modern age, so they will have lots more colors and</p>

<h2 id="further-exploration">Further Exploration</h2>

<p>As you can imagine, this is just a taste of the command line. You can do so so much more. Hopefully this was just enough to wet your appetite, and make you eager to explore more. One great place to start is with <a href="https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix" title="Modern Unix">Modern Unix</a>. This is a project that has upgrades many of the commands we just talked about to fit with the modern world, (e.g., adding colors, speed, etc.). Another way to speed things up is to make alias which you can write short hand for really long commands.</p>

<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>

<p>Try to make a new folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git_repos</code> somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. 
Then make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file (for advanced users try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> to edit it and say something).</p>

<p>Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). 
Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>my_first_bash_script/
  |-- analyses/
      |-- plots/
  |-- expriment/
      |-- data/
  |-- lit_review/
  |-- supporting_docs/
      |-- scales/
      |-- irb_docs/  
  |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md
  |-- README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. 
I highly highly reccommend two separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> files. 
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code> is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). 
In contrast the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEVELOPMENT</code> file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project.
Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. 
I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. 
This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable.</p>
