By the end of this you will know: Basic commands to traverse your computer from the terminal The structure or commands, arguments, and options in bash How to edit, create, move and delete files Create a script to make a folder structure for each new project you are working on. Prerequisites: Have read through the previous post on bash or have a general understanding of how to move around in bash Building your Knowledge After you have gone through the last section its time to remove the training wheels. To learn to code, you need 1) to try to implement the skills that you have learned and 2) the space to come up with creative solutions to your problems. So my goal is to motivate you by showing you kool useful ideas/commands to spark your creativity to inspire you to create something I just want to scaffold you just enough so that you can figure things out on your own and solve problems that are important/useful to you. The best way to learn is for you to come up with creative ways to combine the commands I showed you and others that I did not, to solve problems that are unique to you, so I going into explicit details on all the commands would also slow you down because I would inevitably end up teaching you a lot of useless commands. To that end, i am intentionally not going to list through all the commands and exaplin in great detail like I did before because that is just not a good way to learn how to code. Here is the general outline for this post: Show the general structure of shell commands Show you how to view and edit files List off a bunch of commands that are generally good to know Finally end off with some examples to inspire you to create your own projects here we will start of form and then go list usefule commands enough to be dangerous Editing Files I left off the last post by hinting and some really neat commands that were centered around creating files and directories. To quickly recap, the mkdir command MaKes a DIRectory, you can even append the -p (for parent) option to make multiple nested directories. The touch command creates an empty file. With echo you can make a file that contains text with echo &quot;SOME TEXT&quot; &gt; file_name, note the &gt;. If you have a single &gt; it will delete all the contents are replace it wil the text, if you include two &gt;&gt;, then you will simply append the text to the file. To remember the arrow direction, I think of it like funneling a lot of text into a file, so from big to little. Now that you know how to make a file, lets learn how to edit a file from the terminal. There are a lot of options to edit files vi, vim, nvim (my preferred option), emacs, and nano. Nano is by far and away the easiest place to start for beginners, so I will cover a few things with it. Again, like the rest of this post, this is just a taste of how to edit file, and with only these skills you wil be able to make some changes, but not be super efficient. For that you will have to do some extra learning on your own. I personally use neovim, which notably has a steep learning curve, but is blazingly fast.

The form of Commands A command is just a mini program that executes when you call it from a terminal. But in order to best understand terminal commands its useful to know how they are structured. Every command has 3 basic (potential) parts. The command itself, any options you can apply, and finally any arguments. As you saw in the previous section with the cd command, we had an argument (the new directory to change to). Again the argument is separated only by a space (no parentheses as you may be used to from other programming languages) and any additional arugments are also separated by a space. For the ls command we learned about the -a option again separated by a space. Options in bash start with a -. It is common practice for single letter options to have a single - and full word arguments have two --. Now that you know how commands are structure the next couple sections will list a bunch of useful basic commands before we end by showing you a way to learn the ins and outs of a command (like its options) and how to find a comand to perform a task you suspect exists. Creating/Deleting Folders and Files Before continuing, try each of the following commands out, just to you know how they work. For all the commands the relevant arguments will be in [] mkdir: Make Directory (folder) [name_of_folder_to_make; use the -p (for make parent directories) if you want to make multiple nested folders simultaneously] touch: Make an Empty File [name_of_file_to_make] cp: Copy [name_of_file_to_copy; name_of_location_to_copy_to] mv: Move [name_of_file_to_move; name_of_location_to_move_to; can also be used to change a files name if you move it to the same location with a new name] rm: Remove a file [name_of_file_to_remove] Viewing Contents and Editing Files nano: A simple to use text editor. You will likely hear about other editors like vim or emacs. Both are really good, but they have a really hard learning curve, so I don’t reccomend them when you start out. I personally use nvim, which is a modern replacement for vim. [name_of_file_to_edit] cat: Concatenate (prints out files contents) [name_of_file_to_print] less: Less (is more… powerful). Useful for printing out really long docs becuse you can scroll through them [name_of_file_to_print] more: More (of the content on screen) Useful for printing out really long docs but not as good as less [name_of_file_to_print] Additional Commands These are some more commands that are either super useful or are just really neat! curl and wget both are used to access websites from the command line brew is a package manager for MacOS that allows you to download pretty much any app from your terminal grep find every file and the specific line number that [“SOME RANDOM TEXT”] appears sed can be used to replace text in a file.

This command allows you to search for all commands the perform function/have anything in their name/description about a topic. [descriptiion_or_name you want to search for] If you only remember one command this is the one to remember man: (Pull up the) Manual (for the respective command so you can learn all the options available) [command you want to know more about similar to help() or ?? in most languages] Probs should go through one example of both see if I can find a good one that has options specified with[] to highlight that common trend and options to note those as well. also state google, its your friend, if you see an error stackoverflow maybe a whol error handling section REAd the error, I am not joking a lot of peole dont read them Try to understand what it is telling you, again for some reason people skip this step. if you still dont understand google the error Some good examples site to seek out are stackoverflow If you are still stuck, first try rephrasing your search and to see if you can solve the problem If you are still stuck, find somone and ask for help. It is important to struggle, that is how you learn, but you dont want to be stuck on a problem for days just because you didnt know how to google it correctly. Use you social resources, people are often quite willing to help if you ask, but for you got to put in the effort Inspiration of course we only touched the surface here, I only really showed you commands that allow you to navigate your file systems, but there are loads other commands as well. For example, there are command to access content from the internet curl commands that lets you access other computers ssh and vlc. My goal here was not have a complete bash tutorial, but rather to get you to a position where you can be dangers and importantly, hopefully show you just enough to spark your ideas on how valuable this is. The next step is for you to apply this knowledge. Make some small app that automates away boring things you have to do all the time. You might not now all the commands necessary to complete the task, but that is ok, you can google a command or better yet, try to search for it with apropos. Some examples my RAs have done in the past include: If you are looking for a place to spruce up your terminal, you can check out the modern unix project, where they attempt to update all the old commands to fit the modern age, so they will have lots more colors and Further Exploration As you can imagine, this is just a taste of the command line. You can do so so much more. Hopefully this was just enough to wet your appetite, and make you eager to explore more. One great place to start is with Modern Unix. This is a project that has upgrades many of the commands we just talked about to fit with the modern world, (e.g., adding colors, speed, etc.). Another way to speed things up is to make alias which you can write short hand for really long commands. Homework Try to make a new folder called git_repos somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. Then make README.md file (for advanced users try nano or vim to edit it and say something). Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure: my_first_bash_script/ |-- analyses/ |-- plots/ |-- expriment/ |-- data/ |-- lit_review/ |-- supporting_docs/ |-- scales/ |-- irb_docs/ |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md |-- README.md Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. I highly highly reccommend two separate .md files. The README is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). In contrast the DEVELOPMENT file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project. Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable." />

Useful for printing out really long docs becuse you can scroll through them [name_of_file_to_print] more: More (of the content on screen) Useful for printing out really long docs but not as good as less [name_of_file_to_print] Additional Commands These are some more commands that are either super useful or are just really neat! curl and wget both are used to access websites from the command line brew is a package manager for MacOS that allows you to download pretty much any app from your terminal grep find every file and the specific line number that [“SOME RANDOM TEXT”] appears sed can be used to replace text in a file. Really helpful in combination with grep cal and date give you a calendar and the date, respectively wc gets the word count of a file (note, I dont think this works on .docpx files) ssh allows you to access another computer sudo allows you run as super user, essentailly having complete access. You will learn more about this command later cmatrix to look like you a hacker in the matrix top, htop, btop, gtop etc. are all different programs to monitor your system neofetch just looks super kool telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl watch an ascii based replication of star wars (no sound, but still super fun) ani-cli and anime-terminal allow you to stream or download full fledge anime from the terminal and even save your watch history Note, the last 4 require you to install them via either your package manager or from github directly Learn New Commands These commands are more important to remember because they let you find a command to do perform and actiona as well as learn how to use that command: apropos: à propos (meaning with regard to). This command allows you to search for all commands the perform function/have anything in their name/description about a topic. [descriptiion_or_name you want to search for] If you only remember one command this is the one to remember man: (Pull up the) Manual (for the respective command so you can learn all the options available) [command you want to know more about similar to help() or ?? in most languages] Probs should go through one example of both see if I can find a good one that has options specified with[] to highlight that common trend and options to note those as well. also state google, its your friend, if you see an error stackoverflow maybe a whol error handling section REAd the error, I am not joking a lot of peole dont read them Try to understand what it is telling you, again for some reason people skip this step. if you still dont understand google the error Some good examples site to seek out are stackoverflow If you are still stuck, first try rephrasing your search and to see if you can solve the problem If you are still stuck, find somone and ask for help. It is important to struggle, that is how you learn, but you dont want to be stuck on a problem for days just because you didnt know how to google it correctly. Use you social resources, people are often quite willing to help if you ask, but for you got to put in the effort Inspiration of course we only touched the surface here, I only really showed you commands that allow you to navigate your file systems, but there are loads other commands as well. For example, there are command to access content from the internet curl commands that lets you access other computers ssh and vlc. My goal here was not have a complete bash tutorial, but rather to get you to a position where you can be dangers and importantly, hopefully show you just enough to spark your ideas on how valuable this is. The next step is for you to apply this knowledge. Make some small app that automates away boring things you have to do all the time. You might not now all the commands necessary to complete the task, but that is ok, you can google a command or better yet, try to search for it with apropos. Some examples my RAs have done in the past include: If you are looking for a place to spruce up your terminal, you can check out the modern unix project, where they attempt to update all the old commands to fit the modern age, so they will have lots more colors and Further Exploration As you can imagine, this is just a taste of the command line. You can do so so much more. Hopefully this was just enough to wet your appetite, and make you eager to explore more. One great place to start is with Modern Unix. This is a project that has upgrades many of the commands we just talked about to fit with the modern world, (e.g., adding colors, speed, etc.). Another way to speed things up is to make alias which you can write short hand for really long commands. Homework Try to make a new folder called git_repos somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. Then make README.md file (for advanced users try nano or vim to edit it and say something). Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure: my_first_bash_script/ |-- analyses/ |-- plots/ |-- expriment/ |-- data/ |-- lit_review/ |-- supporting_docs/ |-- scales/ |-- irb_docs/ |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md |-- README.md Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. I highly highly reccommend two separate .md files. The README is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). In contrast the DEVELOPMENT file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project. Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable.","headline":"Take your bash Skills to the Next Level","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:4000/cli/bash2"},"url":"http://localhost:4000/cli/bash2"}</script>

<section class="takeaways">

  <p>In this blog you will learn basic bash commands. By the end of this you will know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Basic commands to traverse your computer from the terminal</li>
    <li>The structure or commands, arguments, and options in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code></li>
    <li>How to edit, create, move and delete files</li>
    <li>Create a script to make a folder structure for each new project you are working on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Prerequisites:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Have read through the previous post on <a href="/cli/bash">bash</a> or have a general understanding of how to move around in bash</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<h2 id="building-your-knowledge">Building your Knowledge</h2>

<p>After you have gone through the last section its time to remove the training wheels.
To learn to code, you need 1) to try to implement the skills that you have learned and 2) the space to come up with creative solutions to your problems.
So my goal is to motivate you by showing you kool useful ideas/commands to spark your creativity to inspire you to create something
I just want to scaffold you just enough so that you can figure things out on your own and solve problems that are important/useful to you.
The best way to learn is for you to come up with creative ways to combine the commands I showed you and others that I did not, to solve problems that are unique to you, so I going into explicit details on all the commands would also slow you down because I would inevitably end up teaching you a lot of useless commands.
To that end, i am intentionally not going to list through all the commands and exaplin in great detail like I did before because that is just not a good way to learn how to code.</p>

<p>Here is the general outline for this post:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show the general structure of shell commands</li>
  <li>Show you how to view and edit files</li>
  <li>List off a bunch of commands that are generally good to know</li>
  <li>Finally end off with some examples to inspire you to create your own projects</li>
</ul>

<p>here we will start of form and then go list usefule commands</p>

<p>enough to be dangerous</p>

<h2 id="editing-files">Editing Files</h2>

<p>I left off the last post by hinting and some really neat commands that were centered around creating files and directories.
To quickly recap, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> command <strong>M</strong>a<strong>K</strong>es a <strong>DIR</strong>ectory, you can even append the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> (for parent) option to make multiple nested directories.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch</code> command creates an empty file.
With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> you can make a file that contains text with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo "SOME TEXT" &gt; file_name</code>, note the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>.
If you have a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> it will delete all the contents are replace it wil the text, if you include two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;</code>, then you will simply append the text to the file.
To remember the arrow direction, I think of it like funneling a lot of text into a file, so from big to little.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to make a file, lets learn how to edit a file from the terminal.
There are a lot of options to edit files vi, vim, nvim (my preferred option), emacs, and nano.
Nano is by far and away the easiest place to start for beginners, so I will cover a few things with it.</p>

<p>Again, like the rest of this post, this is just a taste of how to edit file, and with only these skills you wil be able to make some changes, but not be super efficient.
For that you will have to do some extra learning on your own.
I personally use neovim, which notably has a steep learning curve, but is <em>blazingly fast</em>.
If you are interested, I would recommend you check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen" title="The Primeagen YT">The Primeagen</a>.
He is a software developer for Netflex that has some amazing videos on <a href="https://youtu.be/H3o4l4GVLW0" title="Primeagen Vim Playlist">vim/neovim</a>.</p>

## Building your Knowledge

I need to at least have them make a document and probably a folder, perhaps give them the sense of jubulation from when you see a folder get created on your desktop. 

I just want to end you with a little spark. This was the moment I got hooked. When I was able to make something on my computer without clicking a button. 
My mind was astounded. 

-->

<h2 id="the-form-of-commands">The form of Commands</h2>

<p>A command is just a mini program that executes when you call it from  a terminal. 
But in order to best understand terminal commands its useful to know how they are structured. 
Every command has 3 basic (potential) parts. 
The command itself, any options you can apply, and finally any arguments.</p>

<p>As you saw in the previous section with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command, we had an argument (the new directory to change to). 
Again the argument is separated only by a space (no parentheses as you may be used to from other programming languages) and any additional arugments are also separated by a space. 
For the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command we learned about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code> option again separated by a space. Options in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> start with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code>. 
It is common practice for single letter options to have a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> and full word arguments have two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code>.</p>

<p>Now that you know how commands are structure the next couple sections will list a bunch of useful basic commands before we end by showing you a way to learn the ins and outs of a command (like its options) and how to find a comand to perform a task you suspect exists.</p>

<h3 id="creatingdeleting-folders-and-files">Creating/Deleting Folders and Files</h3>

<p>Before continuing, try each of the following commands out, just to you know how they work.</p>

<p>For all the commands the relevant arguments will be in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code>: Make Directory (folder) [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_folder_to_make</code>; use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> (for make parent directories) if you want to make multiple nested folders simultaneously]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch</code>: Make an Empty File [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_make</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code>: Copy [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_copy</code>; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_location_to_copy_to</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code>: Move [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_move</code>; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_location_to_move_to</code>; can also be used to change a files name if you move it to the same location with a new name]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code>: Remove a file [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_remove</code>]</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="viewing-contents-and-editing-files">Viewing Contents and Editing Files</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code>: A simple to use text editor. You will likely hear about other editors like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emacs</code>. Both are really good, but they have a really hard learning curve, so I don’t reccomend them when you start out. I personally use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvim</code>, which is a modern replacement for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code>. [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_edit</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code>: Concatenate (prints out files contents) [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_print</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code>: Less (is more… powerful). Useful for printing out really long docs becuse you can scroll through them [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_print</code>]</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">more</code>: More (of the content on screen) Useful for printing out really long docs but not as good as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code> [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_of_file_to_print</code>]</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="additional-commands">Additional Commands</h3>

<p>These are some more commands that are either super useful or are just really neat!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> both are used to access websites from the command line</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code> is a <a href="/future-links">package manager</a> for MacOS that allows you to download pretty much any app from your terminal</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> find every file and the specific line number that [“SOME RANDOM TEXT”] appears</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> can be used to replace text in a file. Really helpful in combination with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cal</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> give you a calendar and the date, respectively</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> gets the word count of a file (note, I dont think this works on .docpx files)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> allows you to access another computer</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo</code> allows you run as super user, essentailly having complete access. You will learn more about this command later</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmatrix</code> to look like you a hacker in the matrix</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">top</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">htop</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">btop</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gtop</code> etc. are all different programs to monitor your system</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neofetch</code> just looks super kool</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl</code> watch an ascii based replication of star wars (no sound, but still super fun)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ani-cli</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anime-terminal</code> allow you to stream or download full fledge anime from the terminal and even save your watch history</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, the last 4 require you to install them via either your <a href="/future-links">package manager</a> or from github directly</p>

<h2 id="learn-new-commands">Learn New Commands</h2>

<p>These commands are more important to remember because they let you find a command to do perform and actiona as well as learn how to use that command:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apropos</code>: à propos (meaning with regard to). This command allows you to search for all commands the perform function/have anything in their name/description about a topic. [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">descriptiion_or_name</code> you want to search for]
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong><em>If you only remember one command this is the one to remember</em></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code>: (Pull up the) Manual (for the respective command so you can learn all the options available) [<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command</code> you want to know more about similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help()</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">??</code> in most languages]</li>
</ul>

<p>Probs should go through one example of both
see if I can find a good one that has options specified with[] to highlight that common trend and options to note those as well.
also state google, its your friend, if you see an error stackoverflow</p>

<p>maybe a whol error handling section</p>
<ol>
  <li>REAd the error, I am not joking a lot of peole dont read them</li>
  <li>Try to understand what it is telling you, again for some reason people skip this step.</li>
  <li>if you still dont understand google the error</li>
  <li>Some good examples site to seek out are stackoverflow</li>
  <li>If you are still stuck, first try rephrasing your search and to see if you can solve the problem</li>
  <li>If you are still stuck, find somone and ask for help. It is important to struggle, that is how you learn, but you dont want to be stuck on a problem for days just because you didnt know how to google it correctly. Use you social resources, people are often quite willing to help if you ask, but for you got to put in the effort</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p>of course we only touched the surface here, I only really showed you commands that allow you to navigate your file systems, but there are loads other commands as well. For example, there are command to access content from the internet <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> commands that lets you access other computers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vlc</code>. My goal here was not have a complete bash tutorial, but rather to get you to a position where you can be dangers and importantly, hopefully show you just enough to spark your ideas on how valuable this is. The next step is for you to apply this knowledge. Make some small app that automates away boring things you have to do all the time. You might not now all the commands necessary to complete the task, but that is ok, you can google a command or better yet, try to search for it with apropos.</p>

<p>Some examples my RAs have done in the past include:</p>

<p>If you are looking for a place to spruce up your terminal, you can check out the modern unix project, where they attempt to update all the old commands to fit the modern age, so they will have lots more colors and</p>

<h2 id="further-exploration">Further Exploration</h2>

<p>As you can imagine, this is just a taste of the command line. You can do so so much more. Hopefully this was just enough to wet your appetite, and make you eager to explore more. One great place to start is with <a href="https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix" title="Modern Unix">Modern Unix</a>. This is a project that has upgrades many of the commands we just talked about to fit with the modern world, (e.g., adding colors, speed, etc.). Another way to speed things up is to make alias which you can write short hand for really long commands.</p>

<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>

<p>Try to make a new folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git_repos</code> somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. 
Then make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file (for advanced users try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> to edit it and say something).</p>

<p>Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). 
Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>my_first_bash_script/
  |-- analyses/
      |-- plots/
  |-- expriment/
      |-- data/
  |-- lit_review/
  |-- supporting_docs/
      |-- scales/
      |-- irb_docs/  
  |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md
  |-- README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. 
I highly highly reccommend two separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> files. 
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code> is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). 
In contrast the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEVELOPMENT</code> file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project.
Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. 
I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. 
This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable.</p>
