<h2 id="git-series">Git Series</h2>

<p>This series will show the the ropes for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>. 
By the end, you should be able to transfer all your project to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> and be able to collaborate with people on GitHub.
Gone will be the days of using a flash drive to move the experiment from your computer to the stimulus pc.
You will learn the proper way to deal with changes to your code.</p>

<h2 id="you-only-need-to-know-3-commands">You Only Need to Know 3 Commands</h2>

<!-- excerpt-start -->

<p>Git often seems super scary at first, so let me just start by saying that 85% of the time you will only need to use these three commands.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .
git commit -m "Relevant Message Describing Changes"
git push
</code></pre></div></div>
<!-- excerpt-end -->

<p>And if you are feeling fancy and want more coverage, adding these six commands will cover 99% of what you need in scientific settings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git init
git clone
git status
git pull
git checkout (-b)
git branch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If, for whatever reason, you are still scared off, there are GUI options to take advantage of to use git (including built into R and VS code and even Desktop app). 
I won’t cover them here; however, this blog will still be useful for you as I will cover the structure of git to help you understand what is happening at a high level.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-git">What is Git?</h2>
<p>Git is a Version Control System, thats all. Its sole purpose is to help you (pontentially from your self). 
And speaking from personal experience, getting comfortable with these commands has saved me from hours of headache.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of things that it can save you from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you try to improve your code (whether its performance, readbility, or just adding a new feature) and somehow everything stops working.</li>
  <li>Save you from the hell of having multiple versions of a file, all of which are named: <img src="/assets/imgs/which_one.png" alt="Which File" /></li>
  <li>Prevent the issue of having different versions on different computers</li>
  <li>Allow easy collaboration on coding files were everyone can edit the same file and merge any changes when it is convenient.</li>
  <li>Have a history of all the changes you have made with the ability to revert back to a point when the code was working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Undoubtedly you have experienced several if not all of these problems in the past.
Well all these problems will be solved when you start incorporating git into your workflow.
All Git will do is keep track of every file in a folder you tell it to.
At various points through development, you can make checkpoints that you can return to if something goes wrong.
If you are working from multiple machines or working with a collaborator, you can all have the must recent code with a shared repo and just  pull the changes as you need them. To get started let’s talk about the different stages of git.</p>

<!-- ### Story Time 

One time I had a very large project (totally several thousand lines of code all together across maybe 10 or so files). 
The project was fully functional but is was not very fast (in fact it was quite slow) and it wasn't documented very well. 
As a result, I decided to fix both problems. 
I started working on improving both issues and after a couple days I noticed that the code broke. 
But I had no idea how or why it stopped working. 
Now if I wasn't using git, I would have been screwed. But luckily, all I had to do was revert back to the previously working commit and I had a fully working version.  -->

<h3 id="four-stages-of-git">Four Stages of Git</h3>

<p>There are 3(4?) basic stages of git. And a file can be in any of these stages. 
<img src="/assets/imgs/git_stages.png" alt="Stages of Git" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Untracked</code>: The first and easiest to understand is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Untracked</code> this is simply a file that is not in the directory/folder git is tracking <strong><em>OR</em></strong> a file you have specifically told git to ignore/not track any changes for it.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unmodified</code>: These are files that you asked git to track but they have not changed since you last made a commit (i.e., made a checkpoint/savepoint).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Modified</code>: These are also files you asked git to track, but these have changed since the last commit.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Staged</code>: Finally, you have files that you have told git to track, made changes to these files, AND you have already added them to the queue (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add FILENAME</code>) and are waiting for the commit and message (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "REALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE"</code>). Once you have committed the changes, the checkpoint is stored and all the selected staged files are now officially <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unmodified</code>. Then the cycle continues.</li>
</ul>
