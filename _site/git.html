GitHub Example GitHub CLI Setup GitHub Repo Setup Common Errors and Hiccups Advanced Topics in Git Homework Additional Resources: &lt;/aside&gt; Takeaways [Estimated Read Time 20 mins] In this blog you will learn the basics of Git and GitHub/GitLab: By the end you will know the 4 stages of the git process All the commands relevant to initalizing and working with a git project Set up your first Git repository Set up your first online repository (via either GitHub or GitLab) Be able to collaborate with any other scientist using Git Prerequisites: None; though it may be helpful to skim through the Command Line (Bash/zsh) post first, especially if you do not know how to use the terminal or how to use a bash. You Only Need to Know 3 Commands Git often seems super scary, so let me just start by saying that 85% of the time you will only use the following three commands. git add . git commit -m &quot;Relevant Message Describing Changes&quot; git push And if you are feeling fancy and want more coverage, adding these six commands will cover 99% of what you need in scientific settings: git init git clone git status git pull git checkout (-b) git branch If, for whatever reason, you are still scared off, there are GUI options to take advantage of to use of git (including built into R and VS code and even Desktop app). I wonâ€™t cover them here; however, this blog will still be useful for you as I will cover the structure of git and help you understand what is happening at a high level. What is Git? Git is a Version Control System, thats all. Its sole purpose is to help you (pontentially from your self). And speaking from personal experience, getting comfortable with these commands has saved me from hours of headache. Here are a few examples of things that it can save you from: When you try to improve your codes performance, readbility, or just adding a new feature and somehow everything stops working. Save you from the hell of having multiple versions of a file, all of which are named: Prevent the issue of having different versions on different computers All easy collaboration on coding files allowing everyone to edit the same file and merge all the changes when it is convenient. Have a history of all the changes you have made with the ability to revert back to a point when the code was working. Git Stages? There are 3(4?) basic stages of git. And a file can be in any of these stages. Untracked: The first and easiest to understand is Untracked this is simply a file that is not even in the directory/folder git is tracking OR a file you have specifically told git to ignore/not track any changes for it. Unmodified: These are files that you asked git to track but they have not changed since you last made a commit (i.e., made a checkpoint). Modified: These are also files you asked git to track, but these have changed since the last commit. Staged: Finally, you have files that you have told git to track, made changes to these files, AND you have already added them to the queue (via git add FILENAME) and are waiting for the commit and message (via git commit -m &quot;REALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE&quot;). Once you have committed the changes, all staged files are now officially unmodified. Then the cycle continues. Git Example Time Installation First double check if you have git installed already via typing git -v in your terminal. If you get a command not found error then you donâ€™t have it install if it spits out a version then you are good to go (though you may need to update it) Mac OS Many scientific applications requires xcode on Mac which install git automatically so you might have it. Double check by using the method described above. If you donâ€™t thatâ€™s ok because you will definitely need it in the future. Inside your terminal type the following command: xcode-select --install If you know what homebrew or MacPorts are you can install them via these methods as well. Finally, you can use the GUI installer go the Binary installer section Hint: You might want to install homebrew with the following command /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot; Linux On most linux distros you can simply use the relavent package manager to install git. For example on debian based distros: sudo apt install git-all Windows You can install git via chocolately or the GUI installer Git Basics Now we will follow a super basic example to git an understanding (pun intended). First letâ€™s set up the following directory structure. Each of the text files should only contain 1 line of text that is just the same as the name of the file without and extension. So the hello_world file can just be have the content Hello World. my_first_git_project/ |-- hello_world.txt |-- goodbye.txt Next we need to create a README.md file. These are super important and as the name implies you should alwasy read this before using some software/code you get online. Hint: This also means that you should always make a readme file anytime you make a project. In this file you will find basic information about how to setup/configure and run the code that you download. It also often describes the basic functionality of the code as this is the first thing anyone will see about the project. On GitHub/GitLab. For our purposes since this is a basic project you can just add the level 1 header and a 1 line description. # My first Git Repo Learning the basics of the a Git! Next we are going to set up your username and email for all the changes that you will make. This isnâ€™t required but its super simple so might as well do it. git config --global user.name &quot;Deshawn Sambrano&quot; git config --global user.email DSambrano@g.harvard.edu Now that that is all taken care of, we can initialize your repo with git init Hint: Make sure you are already cdâ€˜d into the correct directory. It is common mistke for people initlized there home folder /Users/Deshawn/ which will track your entire computer ðŸ˜±! Even I did it when I frist started ðŸ˜…. But donâ€™t worry you can just remove any .git dir to stop tracking. You can confirm everything worked correctly with the ls -a command. If you see an output that shows a .git file then you have correctly initâ€™d your repo ðŸŽ‰. You can also use git status to see the status of the repo. This is a helpful command that will tell you what branch you are on, and shows all the files in the directory and which stage they are in. Next we need to tell get to track all the files. We can do this individually with git add hello_world.txt goodbye.txt or you can use the shortcut to add all files. git add . where the . just means add everything. Once done, the git status will update letting you know everything is ready to be commited. And the final step is to tell git to save all the changes in a checkpoint for you. This can be done with: git commit -m &quot;Relevant Message&quot; For the message since this is the first one Inital Commit works, but for all future commits, I recommend that you make something that concisely explains the changes that are being made. Each time we want to save the current state of the repo we need to add all relevant files (most of the time you just add everything with git add .) and then commit them with a relevant message git commit -m &quot;Important message&quot; need to add infor about the .gitignore Git Banches and Merging Now that we have edit file add and commit it git checkout -b dev update file git checkout main update file different line and commit git merge dev no conflicts then repeat but the same line and resolve the conflicts How Does GitHub/GitLab Factor Into all of This? GitHub (and GitLab an open source alternative) are primarly used (for our level of programming) as remote (i.e., cloud-based) repositories/server/storage locations. GitHub used to be open source but was bought out by Microsoft and no longer is (there was also a thing in which Microsoft without the knowledge of its users took thousands of repos and used them to develop and AI so if you hear arguments about it these are the two reasons why). Both GitHub and GitLab have several nice helpful features to make developers communicate and interact with one another more and encourage collaboration etc. However, as I meantioned most of the time, you will simply use them as only repos (repositories) of your own code or as a way to find other peopleâ€™s code. Once you have made a GitHub/GitLab account and authorized yourself on your machine, you will be able to add a remote destination (i.e., your GitHub/GitLab account page) to push (via git push) all the changes and commits you have made. The git push commands simply send all the changes that you made locally on your computer to the remote server. No you always have a backup in case something goes wrong with your computer, WAHOO!! Very commonly, you will need to download either your own code (to a new computer) or download someone elseâ€™s code. In order to do this you will use git clone URL-TO-THE-REMOTE-REPO. This will clone the repo to your local machine, and importantly, it will also download all the changes that were ever made, so you have a full history of the project. Why Canâ€™t I Just DropBox (or Google Drive)? Why do I Need Git? At this point, you might be wondering, ok, if git just adds version control abilities why canâ€™t I just use DropBox or Google Drive. What does Git add that I couldnâ€™t just get from these sources. This is kinda like saying why doesnâ€™t a surgeon use a knife instead of a scalpel. Sure a knife can do a lot of the job, but they are designed for different things. DropBox/Drive are general purpose storage tools (like a knife) while git is specifically designed for writing code. That being said, letâ€™s highlight specific examples: While you do get some history of a file on both platforms, neither provides any information about what is different between the different versions. So you would need to remember what changes you personally made on April 23, 2022 at 4:00 pm compared the April 23, 2022 at 4:15 pm. First of all there is no chance that you remember what was different. In contrast, with git you have all the information stored with a message for every commit made. But letâ€™s pretend you have an insane memory and actually do remeber a general gist of what was differnt. You still wonâ€™t find the specific differences without opening both files and comparing them. Again, with git, you have a single command to see all the changes made to that file. They can also be easier viewed view GitHub/GitLab. Git does Delta changes meaning that it uses a lot less resources in terms of network bandwidth, storage, and general computing resources. Similar to the previous example, This requires you to store all of the data. What if you computer doesnt have enough storage. Instead using Git and GitHub, you will only need to download and store the relevant components and you can delete them at any time to reclaim your storage. And perhaps the most relatable example is, when you want to change code (and you are using DropBox/Google Drive) what do you do. My bet, is that you comment out the old code and create the new code (that way if something breaks you can always go back). But what if somehting doesnâ€™t break right away. What if it takes a while to realize that this caused a problem. Are you just going to leave the old commented version in there for ever? If you do then you wonâ€™t have very maintainable code, because the amount of comments are quickly going to explode. In constrast, with git, you just save the version as a commit make the changes, and if anything goes wrong, just rewind back to the latest commit. GitHub Example If you did not install brew before it would be a good idea to do so now: # Installs homebrew /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot; # Installs git and github command line tools brew install git gh but again, if you donâ€™t want to you can just install the github command line tools from there website. Once done you will need to set everything up with gh auth login and follow the on screen prompt GitHub CLI Setup There are two methods to give yourself GitHub access via git. The first is HTTPS and the second is SSH. These are two security protocols (details on SSH in a future post), but it doesnt really matter which one you pick, but you have to know which one you are using because there are some slight changes depending on which on you choose. I personally use SSH, but again it doesnt matter. GitHub Repo Setup When you create a new repo on Github you will be prompted with the following options. Fill them as needed until you get the next section. Assuming you did not add a README.md, .gitignore or license then you will see the follow screen. Following these prompts will get you set up, but I do want to highlight what each are doing so you donâ€™t need to follow them ever time. The echo line creates a README file with a title header. Next we had the git init which initializes a repo, as we showed above. Next we are asked to add the README file and git commit it. Afterwards it uses the git branch -M main to rename to current branch to main which is the default branch naming scheme for GitHub. Then, we use git remote add to add the newly created GitHub repo as the remote repo for this project, and we give it a nickname called origin. Finally, we push the all local commits with git push and the -u orign main option/arguments tell git to always use this particular GitHub repo for this branch. Hint: You can actually store different branches on different repos (or the same repo, which is the most common). Common Errors and Hiccups Initalizing a git repo on your whole Computer (or your home directory ~) Trying to download a HTML file from GitHub Advanced Topics in Git We covered a lot today, thankfully, that is most of the important things you need. However, there are a few advanced topics that I do think are useful to know, even though you might not use them a bunch: .gitignore: I use this the most on the list. This allows you to tell git to ignore specific files. This is super useful if you have a file that contains any sensative information (e.g., SECRETE_KEYS, Identifiable Subject data, etc.). git diff : a function to specifically see what has changed line by line since the last commit Fork: A fork is when another person takes your existing projects and adds their own spin or flavor on top and then stores it on their own repo. Pull Request: This is a mechanism to allow either other team memebers or other developers to update your code and merge it with the main branch. Homework I want you to take one of your projects and initialize it as a git project and store it remotely. This can be as a private repo if need be Additional Resources: fireshipio" />

Have a history of all the changes you have made with the ability to revert back to a point when the code was working. Git Stages? There are 3(4?) basic stages of git. And a file can be in any of these stages. Untracked: The first and easiest to understand is Untracked this is simply a file that is not even in the directory/folder git is tracking OR a file you have specifically told git to ignore/not track any changes for it. Unmodified: These are files that you asked git to track but they have not changed since you last made a commit (i.e., made a checkpoint). Modified: These are also files you asked git to track, but these have changed since the last commit. Staged: Finally, you have files that you have told git to track, made changes to these files, AND you have already added them to the queue (via git add FILENAME) and are waiting for the commit and message (via git commit -m &quot;REALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE&quot;). Once you have committed the changes, all staged files are now officially unmodified. Then the cycle continues. Git Example Time Installation First double check if you have git installed already via typing git -v in your terminal. If you get a command not found error then you donâ€™t have it install if it spits out a version then you are good to go (though you may need to update it) Mac OS Many scientific applications requires xcode on Mac which install git automatically so you might have it. Double check by using the method described above. If you donâ€™t thatâ€™s ok because you will definitely need it in the future. Inside your terminal type the following command: xcode-select --install If you know what homebrew or MacPorts are you can install them via these methods as well. Finally, you can use the GUI installer go the Binary installer section Hint: You might want to install homebrew with the following command /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot; Linux On most linux distros you can simply use the relavent package manager to install git. For example on debian based distros: sudo apt install git-all Windows You can install git via chocolately or the GUI installer Git Basics Now we will follow a super basic example to git an understanding (pun intended). First letâ€™s set up the following directory structure. Each of the text files should only contain 1 line of text that is just the same as the name of the file without and extension. So the hello_world file can just be have the content Hello World. my_first_git_project/ |-- hello_world.txt |-- goodbye.txt Next we need to create a README.md file. These are super important and as the name implies you should alwasy read this before using some software/code you get online. Hint: This also means that you should always make a readme file anytime you make a project. In this file you will find basic information about how to setup/configure and run the code that you download. It also often describes the basic functionality of the code as this is the first thing anyone will see about the project. On GitHub/GitLab. For our purposes since this is a basic project you can just add the level 1 header and a 1 line description. # My first Git Repo Learning the basics of the a Git! Next we are going to set up your username and email for all the changes that you will make. This isnâ€™t required but its super simple so might as well do it. git config --global user.name &quot;Deshawn Sambrano&quot; git config --global user.email DSambrano@g.harvard.edu Now that that is all taken care of, we can initialize your repo with git init Hint: Make sure you are already cdâ€˜d into the correct directory. It is common mistke for people initlized there home folder /Users/Deshawn/ which will track your entire computer ðŸ˜±! Even I did it when I frist started ðŸ˜…. But donâ€™t worry you can just remove any .git dir to stop tracking. You can confirm everything worked correctly with the ls -a command. If you see an output that shows a .git file then you have correctly initâ€™d your repo ðŸŽ‰. You can also use git status to see the status of the repo. This is a helpful command that will tell you what branch you are on, and shows all the files in the directory and which stage they are in. Next we need to tell get to track all the files. We can do this individually with git add hello_world.txt goodbye.txt or you can use the shortcut to add all files. git add . where the . just means add everything. Once done, the git status will update letting you know everything is ready to be commited. And the final step is to tell git to save all the changes in a checkpoint for you. This can be done with: git commit -m &quot;Relevant Message&quot; For the message since this is the first one Inital Commit works, but for all future commits, I recommend that you make something that concisely explains the changes that are being made. Each time we want to save the current state of the repo we need to add all relevant files (most of the time you just add everything with git add .) and then commit them with a relevant message git commit -m &quot;Important message&quot; need to add infor about the .gitignore Git Banches and Merging Now that we have edit file add and commit it git checkout -b dev update file git checkout main update file different line and commit git merge dev no conflicts then repeat but the same line and resolve the conflicts How Does GitHub/GitLab Factor Into all of This? GitHub (and GitLab an open source alternative) are primarly used (for our level of programming) as remote (i.e., cloud-based) repositories/server/storage locations. GitHub used to be open source but was bought out by Microsoft and no longer is (there was also a thing in which Microsoft without the knowledge of its users took thousands of repos and used them to develop and AI so if you hear arguments about it these are the two reasons why). Both GitHub and GitLab have several nice helpful features to make developers communicate and interact with one another more and encourage collaboration etc. However, as I meantioned most of the time, you will simply use them as only repos (repositories) of your own code or as a way to find other peopleâ€™s code. Once you have made a GitHub/GitLab account and authorized yourself on your machine, you will be able to add a remote destination (i.e., your GitHub/GitLab account page) to push (via git push) all the changes and commits you have made. The git push commands simply send all the changes that you made locally on your computer to the remote server. No you always have a backup in case something goes wrong with your computer, WAHOO!! Very commonly, you will need to download either your own code (to a new computer) or download someone elseâ€™s code. In order to do this you will use git clone URL-TO-THE-REMOTE-REPO. This will clone the repo to your local machine, and importantly, it will also download all the changes that were ever made, so you have a full history of the project. Why Canâ€™t I Just DropBox (or Google Drive)? Why do I Need Git? At this point, you might be wondering, ok, if git just adds version control abilities why canâ€™t I just use DropBox or Google Drive. What does Git add that I couldnâ€™t just get from these sources. This is kinda like saying why doesnâ€™t a surgeon use a knife instead of a scalpel. Sure a knife can do a lot of the job, but they are designed for different things. DropBox/Drive are general purpose storage tools (like a knife) while git is specifically designed for writing code. That being said, letâ€™s highlight specific examples: While you do get some history of a file on both platforms, neither provides any information about what is different between the different versions. So you would need to remember what changes you personally made on April 23, 2022 at 4:00 pm compared the April 23, 2022 at 4:15 pm. First of all there is no chance that you remember what was different. In contrast, with git you have all the information stored with a message for every commit made. But letâ€™s pretend you have an insane memory and actually do remeber a general gist of what was differnt. You still wonâ€™t find the specific differences without opening both files and comparing them. Again, with git, you have a single command to see all the changes made to that file. They can also be easier viewed view GitHub/GitLab. Git does Delta changes meaning that it uses a lot less resources in terms of network bandwidth, storage, and general computing resources. Similar to the previous example, This requires you to store all of the data. What if you computer doesnt have enough storage. Instead using Git and GitHub, you will only need to download and store the relevant components and you can delete them at any time to reclaim your storage. And perhaps the most relatable example is, when you want to change code (and you are using DropBox/Google Drive) what do you do. My bet, is that you comment out the old code and create the new code (that way if something breaks you can always go back). But what if somehting doesnâ€™t break right away. What if it takes a while to realize that this caused a problem. Are you just going to leave the old commented version in there for ever? If you do then you wonâ€™t have very maintainable code, because the amount of comments are quickly going to explode. In constrast, with git, you just save the version as a commit make the changes, and if anything goes wrong, just rewind back to the latest commit. GitHub Example If you did not install brew before it would be a good idea to do so now: # Installs homebrew /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot; # Installs git and github command line tools brew install git gh but again, if you donâ€™t want to you can just install the github command line tools from there website. Once done you will need to set everything up with gh auth login and follow the on screen prompt GitHub CLI Setup There are two methods to give yourself GitHub access via git. The first is HTTPS and the second is SSH. These are two security protocols (details on SSH in a future post), but it doesnt really matter which one you pick, but you have to know which one you are using because there are some slight changes depending on which on you choose. I personally use SSH, but again it doesnt matter. GitHub Repo Setup When you create a new repo on Github you will be prompted with the following options. Fill them as needed until you get the next section. Assuming you did not add a README.md, .gitignore or license then you will see the follow screen. Following these prompts will get you set up, but I do want to highlight what each are doing so you donâ€™t need to follow them ever time. The echo line creates a README file with a title header. Next we had the git init which initializes a repo, as we showed above. Next we are asked to add the README file and git commit it. Afterwards it uses the git branch -M main to rename to current branch to main which is the default branch naming scheme for GitHub. Then, we use git remote add to add the newly created GitHub repo as the remote repo for this project, and we give it a nickname called origin. Finally, we push the all local commits with git push and the -u orign main option/arguments tell git to always use this particular GitHub repo for this branch. Hint: You can actually store different branches on different repos (or the same repo, which is the most common). Common Errors and Hiccups Initalizing a git repo on your whole Computer (or your home directory ~) Trying to download a HTML file from GitHub Advanced Topics in Git We covered a lot today, thankfully, that is most of the important things you need. However, there are a few advanced topics that I do think are useful to know, even though you might not use them a bunch: .gitignore: I use this the most on the list. This allows you to tell git to ignore specific files. This is super useful if you have a file that contains any sensative information (e.g., SECRETE_KEYS, Identifiable Subject data, etc.). git diff : a function to specifically see what has changed line by line since the last commit Fork: A fork is when another person takes your existing projects and adds their own spin or flavor on top and then stores it on their own repo. Pull Request: This is a mechanism to allow either other team memebers or other developers to update your code and merge it with the main branch. Homework I want you to take one of your projects and initialize it as a git project and store it remotely. This can be as a private repo if need be Additional Resources: fireshipio","headline":"Git and GitHub: Whats the Big Deal","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:4000/git"},"url":"http://localhost:4000/git"}</script>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>[Estimated Read Time 20 mins]</p>

<p>In this blog you will learn the basics of Git and GitHub/GitLab:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By the end you will know the 4 stages of the git process</li>
  <li>All the commands relevant to initalizing and working with a git project</li>
  <li>Set up your first Git repository</li>
  <li>Set up your first online repository (via either GitHub or GitLab)</li>
  <li>Be able to collaborate with any other scientist using Git</li>
</ul>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>None; though it may be helpful to skim through the <a href="cli.md">Command Line (Bash/zsh)</a> post first, especially if you do not know how to use the terminal or how to use a bash.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="you-only-need-to-know-3-commands">You Only Need to Know 3 Commands</h2>

<!-- excerpt-start -->

<p>Git often seems super scary, so let me just start by saying that 85% of the time you will only use the following three commands.</p>

<!-- excerpt-end -->

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .

git commit -m "Relevant Message Describing Changes"

git push
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And if you are feeling fancy and want more coverage, adding these six commands will cover 99% of what you need in scientific settings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git init
git clone
git status
git pull
git checkout (-b)
git branch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If, for whatever reason, you are still scared off, there are GUI options to take advantage of to use of git (including built into R and VS code and even Desktop app). 
I wonâ€™t cover them here; however, this blog will still be useful for you as I will cover the structure of git and help you understand what is happening at a high level.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-git">What is Git?</h1>
<p>Git is a Version Control System, thats all. Its sole purpose is to help you (pontentially from your self). 
And speaking from personal experience, getting comfortable with these commands has saved me from hours of headache.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of things that it can save you from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you try to improve your codes performance, readbility, or just adding a new feature and somehow everything stops working.</li>
  <li>Save you from the hell of having multiple versions of a file, all of which are named: <img src="/assets/imgs/which_one.png" alt="Which File" /></li>
  <li>Prevent the issue of having different versions on different computers</li>
  <li>All easy collaboration on coding files allowing everyone to edit the same file and merge all the changes when it is convenient.</li>
  <li>Have a history of all the changes you have made with the ability to revert back to a point when the code was working.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ### Story Time 

One time I had a very large project (totally several thousand lines of code all together across maybe 10 or so files). 
The project was fully functional but is was not very fast (in fact it was quite slow) and it wasn't documented very well. 
As a result, I decided to fix both problems. 
I started working on improving both issues and after a couple days I noticed that the code broke. 
But I had no idea how or why it stopped working. 
Now if I wasn't using git, I would have been screwed. But luckily, all I had to do was revert back to the previously working commit and I had a fully working version.  -->

<h2 id="git-stages">Git Stages?</h2>
<p>There are 3(4?) basic stages of git. And a file can be in any of these stages. 
<img src="/assets/imgs/git_stages.png" alt="Stages of Git" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Untracked</code>: The first and easiest to understand is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Untracked</code> this is simply a file that is not even in the directory/folder git is tracking <strong><em>OR</em></strong> a file you have specifically told git to ignore/not track any changes for it.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unmodified</code>: These are files that you asked git to track but they have not changed since you last made a commit (i.e., made a checkpoint).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Modified</code>: These are also files you asked git to track, but these have changed since the last commit.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Staged</code>: Finally, you have files that you have told git to track, made changes to these files, AND you have already added them to the queue (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add FILENAME</code>) and are waiting for the commit and message (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "REALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE"</code>). Once you have committed the changes, all staged files are now officially <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unmodified</code>. Then the cycle continues.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="git-example-time">Git Example Time</h2>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>First double check if you have git installed already via typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git -v</code> in your terminal. 
If you get a command not found error then you donâ€™t have it install if it spits out a version then you are good to go (though you may need to update it)</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="mac-os">Mac OS</h4>

<p>Many scientific applications requires <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcode</code> on Mac which install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> automatically so you might have it. 
Double check by using the method described <a href="#installation">above</a>. 
If you donâ€™t thatâ€™s ok because you will definitely need it in the future. 
Inside your terminal type the following command:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>xcode-select --install
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you know what homebrew or MacPorts are you can install them via these methods as well.</p>

<p>Finally, you can use the GUI installer go the <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac">Binary installer section</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: You might want to install homebrew with the following command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="linux">Linux</h4>
<p>On most linux distros you can simply use the relavent package manager to install git. 
For example on debian based distros:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install git-all</code></p>

<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>

<p>You can install git via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chocolately</code> or the <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">GUI installer</a></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="git-basics">Git Basics</h3>

<p>Now we will follow a super basic example to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>  an understanding (pun intended). 
First letâ€™s set up the following directory structure. 
Each of the text files should only contain 1 line of text that is just the same as the name of the file without and extension. 
So the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello_world</code> file can just be have the content <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hello World</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>my_first_git_project/
  |-- hello_world.txt
  |-- goodbye.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we need to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file. These are super important and as the name implies you should alwasy read this before using some software/code you get online.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: This also means that you should always make a readme file anytime you make a project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this file you will find basic information about how to setup/configure and run the code that you download. 
It also often describes the basic functionality of the code as this is the first thing anyone will see about the project. 
On GitHub/GitLab. 
For our purposes since this is a basic project you can just add the level 1 header and a 1 line description.</p>
<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh"># My first Git Repo</span>

Learning the basics of the a Git!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we are going to set up your username and email for all the changes that you will make. 
This isnâ€™t required but its super simple so might as well do it.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.name <span class="s2">"Deshawn Sambrano"</span>
git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.email DSambrano@g.harvard.edu
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that that is all taken care of, we can initialize your repo with</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git init
</code></pre></div></div>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: Make sure you are already <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>â€˜d into the correct directory. 
It is common mistke for people initlized there home folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/Deshawn/</code> which will track your entire computer ðŸ˜±! 
Even I did it when I frist started ðŸ˜…. But donâ€™t worry you can just remove any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> dir to stop tracking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can confirm everything worked correctly with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -a</code> command. 
If you see an output that shows a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> file then you have correctly initâ€™d your repo ðŸŽ‰.</p>

<p>You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code> to see the status of the repo. 
This is a helpful command that will tell you what branch you are on, and shows all the files in the directory and which stage they are in. 
<img src="/assets/imgs/git_status_untracked.png" alt="" />
Next we need to tell get to track all the files. We can do this individually with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add hello_world.txt goodbye.txt</code> or you can use the shortcut to add all files.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> just means add everything. Once done, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code> will update letting you know everything is ready to be commited.
<br /><br />
<img src="imgs/git_status_new.png" alt="pwd" width="325" /> 
<br /><br /></p>

<p>And the final step is to tell <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> to save all the changes in a checkpoint for you. 
This can be done with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git commit -m "Relevant Message"
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>For the message since this is the first one <strong><em>Inital Commit</em></strong> works, but for all future commits, I recommend that you make something that concisely explains the changes that are being made.</p>

<p>Each time we want to save the current state of the repo we need to add all relevant files (most of the time you just add everything with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add .</code>) and then commit them with a relevant message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "Important message"</code></p>

<hr />
<p>need to add infor about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="git-banches-and-merging">Git Banches and Merging</h3>

<hr />
<p>Now that we have</p>

<p>edit file
add and commit it
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout -b dev</code>
update file
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout main</code>
update file different line and commit
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git merge dev</code>
no conflicts 
then repeat but the same line and resolve the conflicts</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-does-githubgitlab-factor-into-all-of-this">How Does GitHub/GitLab Factor Into all of This?</h2>
<p>GitHub (and GitLab an open source alternative) are primarly used (for our level of programming) as remote (i.e., cloud-based) repositories/server/storage locations. 
GitHub used to be open source but was bought out by Microsoft and no longer is (there was also a thing in which Microsoft without the knowledge of its users took thousands of repos and used them to develop and AI so if you hear arguments about it these are the two reasons why). 
Both GitHub and GitLab have several nice helpful features to make developers communicate and interact with one another more and encourage collaboration etc. 
However, as I meantioned most of the time, you will simply use them as only repos (repositories) of your own code or as a way to find other peopleâ€™s code.</p>

<p>Once you have made a GitHub/GitLab account and authorized yourself on your machine, you will be able to add a remote destination (i.e., your GitHub/GitLab account page) to push (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code>) all the changes and commits you have made.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code> commands simply send all the changes that you made locally on your computer to the remote server. 
No you always have a backup in case something goes wrong with your computer, WAHOO!!</p>

<p>Very commonly, you will need to download either your own code (to a new computer) or download someone elseâ€™s code. 
In order to do this you will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone URL-TO-THE-REMOTE-REPO</code>. 
This will clone the repo to your local machine, and importantly, it will also download all the changes that were ever made, so you have a full history of the project.</p>

<h3 id="why-cant-i-just-dropbox-or-google-drive-why-do-i-need-git">Why Canâ€™t I Just DropBox (or Google Drive)? Why do I <strong><em>Need</em></strong> Git?</h3>

<p>At this point, you might be wondering, ok, if git just adds version control abilities why canâ€™t I just use DropBox or Google Drive. 
What does Git add that I couldnâ€™t just get from these sources.</p>

<p>This is kinda like saying why doesnâ€™t a surgeon use a knife instead of a scalpel.
Sure a knife can do a lot of the job, but they are designed for different things. 
DropBox/Drive are general purpose storage tools (like a knife) while git is specifically designed for writing code. 
That being said, letâ€™s highlight specific examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li>While you do get some history of a file on both platforms, neither provides any information about what is different between the different versions. So you would need to remember what changes you personally made on April 23, 2022 at 4:00 pm compared the April 23, 2022 at 4:15 pm. First of all there is no chance that you remember what was different. In contrast, with git you have all the information stored with a message for every commit made.</li>
  <li>But letâ€™s pretend you have an insane memory and actually do remeber a general gist of what was differnt. You still wonâ€™t find the specific differences without opening both files and comparing them. Again, with git, you have a single command to see all the changes made to that file. They can also be easier viewed view GitHub/GitLab.</li>
  <li>Git does Delta changes meaning that it uses a lot less resources in terms of network bandwidth, storage, and general computing resources.</li>
  <li>Similar to the previous example, This requires you to store all of the data. What if you computer doesnt have enough storage. Instead using Git and GitHub, you will only need to download and store the relevant components and you can delete them at any time to reclaim your storage.</li>
  <li>And perhaps the most relatable example is, when you want to change code (and you are using DropBox/Google Drive) what do you do. My bet, is that you comment out the old code and create the new code (that way if something breaks you can always go back). But what if somehting doesnâ€™t break right away. What if it takes a while to realize that this caused a problem. Are you just going to leave the old commented version in there for ever? If you do then you wonâ€™t have very maintainable code, because the amount of comments are quickly going to explode. In constrast, with git, you just save the version as a commit make the changes, and if <em>anything</em> goes wrong, just rewind back to the latest commit.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="github-example">GitHub Example</h3>
<p>If you did not install brew before it would be a good idea to do so now:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Installs homebrew</span>
/bin/bash <span class="nt">-c</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">$(</span>curl <span class="nt">-fsSL</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh<span class="si">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>

<span class="c"># Installs git and github command line tools</span>
brew <span class="nb">install </span>git gh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but again, if you donâ€™t want to you can just install the github command line tools from there <a href="https://cli.github.com">website</a>. 
Once done you will need to set everything up with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh auth login</code> and follow the on screen prompt</p>

<!-- ```
gh auth login 
``` -->

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/gh_auth.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="github-cli-setup">GitHub CLI Setup</h4>
<p>There are two methods to give yourself GitHub access via git. The first is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTPS</code> and the second is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SSH</code>. 
These are two security protocols (details on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SSH</code> in a future post), but it doesnt really matter which one you pick, but you have to know which one you are using because there are some slight changes depending on which on you choose. 
I personally use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SSH</code>, but again it doesnt matter.</p>

<h4 id="github-repo-setup">GitHub Repo Setup</h4>

<p>When you create a new repo on Github you will be prompted with the following options. Fill them as needed until you get the next section. 
<img src="/assets/imgs/gh_p1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Assuming you did not add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">license</code> then you will see the follow screen. 
<img src="/assets/imgs/gh_p2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Following these prompts will get you set up, but I do want to highlight what each are doing so you donâ€™t need to follow them ever time. 
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> line creates a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code> file with a title header.
Next we had the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git init</code> which initializes a repo, as we showed above. 
Next we are asked to add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code> file and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> it.
Afterwards it uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git branch -M main</code> to rename to current branch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> which is the default branch naming scheme for GitHub. 
Then, we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git remote add</code> to add the newly created GitHub repo as the remote repo for this project, and we give it a nickname called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">origin</code>. 
Finally, we push the all local commits with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-u orign main</code> option/arguments tell git to always use this particular GitHub repo for this branch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: You can actually store different branches on different repos (or the same repo, which is the most common).</p>

<h2 id="common-errors-and-hiccups">Common Errors and Hiccups</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Initalizing a git repo on your whole Computer (or your home directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code>)</li>
  <li>Trying to download a HTML file from GitHub</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advanced-topics-in-git">Advanced Topics in Git</h2>
<p>We covered a lot today, thankfully, that is most of the important things you need. 
However, there are a few advanced topics that I do think are useful to know, even though you might not use them a bunch:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>: I use this the most on the list. This allows you to tell git to ignore specific files. This is super useful if you have a file that contains any sensative information (e.g., SECRETE_KEYS, Identifiable Subject data, etc.).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git diff </code>: a function to specifically see what has changed line by line since the last commit
<!-- - Branches: These are when you take your existing project and have a seperate timeline for it. This is super useful to make a branch if you are going to make a major change to it that might break things. Need example --></li>
  <li>Fork: A fork is when another person takes your existing projects and adds their own spin or flavor on top and then stores it on their own repo.</li>
  <li>Pull Request: This is a mechanism to allow either other team memebers or other developers to update your code and merge it with the main branch.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<p>I want you to take one of your projects and initialize it as a git project and store it remotely. 
This can be as a private repo if need be</p>
