<h2 id="you-only-need-to-know-3-commands">You Only Need to Know 3 Commands</h2>

<!-- excerpt-start -->

<p>Git often seems super scary, so let me just start by saying that 85% of the time you will only need to use these three commands.</p>

<!-- excerpt-end -->

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .
git commit -m "Relevant Message Describing Changes"
git push
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And if you are feeling fancy and want more coverage, adding these six commands will cover 99% of what you need in scientific settings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git init
git clone
git status
git pull
git checkout (-b)
git branch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If, for whatever reason, you are still scared off, there are GUI options to take advantage of to use git (including built into R and VS code and even Desktop app). 
I won’t cover them here; however, this blog will still be useful for you as I will cover the structure of git to help you understand what is happening at a high level.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-git">What is Git?</h1>
<p>Git is a Version Control System, thats all. Its sole purpose is to help you (pontentially from your self). 
And speaking from personal experience, getting comfortable with these commands has saved me from hours of headache.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of things that it can save you from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you try to improve your code (whether its performance, readbility, or just adding a new feature) and somehow everything stops working.</li>
  <li>Save you from the hell of having multiple versions of a file, all of which are named: <img src="/assets/imgs/which_one.png" alt="Which File" /></li>
  <li>Prevent the issue of having different versions on different computers</li>
  <li>Allow easy collaboration on coding files were everyone can edit the same file and merge any changes when it is convenient.</li>
  <li>Have a history of all the changes you have made with the ability to revert back to a point when the code was working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Undoubtedly you have experienced several if not all of these problems in the past.
Well all these problems will be solved when you start incorporating git into your workflow.
All Git will do is keep track of every file in a folder you tell it to.
At various points through development, you can make checkpoints that you can return to if something goes wrong.
If you are working from multiple machines or working with a collaborator, you can all have the must recent code with a shared repo and just  pull the changes as you need them. To get started let’s talk about the different stages of git.</p>

<!-- ### Story Time 

One time I had a very large project (totally several thousand lines of code all together across maybe 10 or so files). 
The project was fully functional but is was not very fast (in fact it was quite slow) and it wasn't documented very well. 
As a result, I decided to fix both problems. 
I started working on improving both issues and after a couple days I noticed that the code broke. 
But I had no idea how or why it stopped working. 
Now if I wasn't using git, I would have been screwed. But luckily, all I had to do was revert back to the previously working commit and I had a fully working version.  -->

<h2 id="git-stages">Git Stages?</h2>
<p>There are 3(4?) basic stages of git. And a file can be in any of these stages. 
<img src="/assets/imgs/git_stages.png" alt="Stages of Git" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Untracked</code>: The first and easiest to understand is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Untracked</code> this is simply a file that is not in the directory/folder git is tracking <strong><em>OR</em></strong> a file you have specifically told git to ignore/not track any changes for it.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unmodified</code>: These are files that you asked git to track but they have not changed since you last made a commit (i.e., made a checkpoint/savepoint).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Modified</code>: These are also files you asked git to track, but these have changed since the last commit.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Staged</code>: Finally, you have files that you have told git to track, made changes to these files, AND you have already added them to the queue (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add FILENAME</code>) and are waiting for the commit and message (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "REALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE"</code>). Once you have committed the changes, the checkpoint is stored and all the selected staged files are now officially <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unmodified</code>. Then the cycle continues.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="git-example-time">Git Example Time</h2>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>First double check if you have git installed already via typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git -v</code> in your terminal. 
If you get a command not found error then you don’t have it install if it spits out a version then you are good to go (though you may need to update it). If you already have git installed you can skip the <a href="#git-basics">installation section</a>. Otherwise go to the installation section relavent to your computer’s software and continue.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="mac-os">Mac OS</h4>

<p>Many scientific applications requires <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcode</code> on Mac which install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> automatically so you might have it. 
Double check by using the method described <a href="#installation">above</a>. 
If you don’t that’s ok because you will definitely need it in the future. 
Inside your terminal of choice, type the following command to install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcode</code>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>xcode-select --install
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you know what homebrew or MacPorts are, you can install them via these methods as well.</p>

<p>Finally, you can use the GUI installer go the <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac">Binary installer section</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: You might want to install homebrew with the following command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="linux">Linux</h4>
<p>On most linux distros you can simply use the relavent package manager to install git. 
For example on debian based distros:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install git-all</code></p>

<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>

<p>You can install git via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chocolately</code> or the <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">GUI installer</a>.
Finally, you can also install git with linux viw the Window’s subsystem for Linux pipeline, if you are familiar with that.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: it might be helpful to install <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">gitbash</a>, so in addition to get, you can also use all the bash commands.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="git-basics">Git Basics</h3>

<p>Now we will follow a super basic example to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>  an understanding (pun intended).
First let’s set up the following directory structure.
Make sure each file has some text in them. 
If you are not sure what to type at least make sure each of the files contain 1 line of text that is just the same as the name of the file without and extension. 
So the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello_world</code> file can just be have the content <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hello World</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>my_first_git_project/
  |-- hello_world.txt
  |-- goodbye.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we need to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file.
These are super important and as the name implies you should alwasy read this before using some software/code you get online.
As the extension implies, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>’s are in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">markdown</code> format.
If you are not familiar with markdown, check out my <a href="/markdown">post</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: This also means that you should always make a readme file anytime you make a project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this file, you will find basic information about how to setup/configure and run the code that you download. 
It also often describes the basic functionality of the code as this is the first thing anyone will see about the project on GitHub/GitLab. 
For our purposes since this is a basic project, you can just add the level 1 header and a 1 line description.</p>

<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh"># My first Git Repo</span>

Learning the basics of the a Git!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we are going to set up your username and email for all the changes that you will make. 
This isn’t required but its super simple so might as well do it.
The follow lines of code assign any changes that you specifically make, to your name. 
Kinda like signing off on your work with a signature, that way we can figure out who did what.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.name <span class="s2">"Deshawn Sambrano"</span>
git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.email DSambrano@g.harvard.edu
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that that is all taken care of, we can initialize your repo with:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git init
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: Make sure you are already <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>‘d into the correct directory. 
It is common mistake for people initlized there home folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/Deshawn/</code> which will track your entire computer 😱! 
Even I did it when I frist started 😅. But don’t worry you can just remove any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> dir to stop tracking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can confirm everything worked correctly with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -a</code> command. 
If you see an output that shows a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> file then you have correctly init’d your repo 🎉.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~ my_first_git_project <span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-a</span>
<span class="nb">.</span>  ..  .git  goodbye.txt  hello_world.txt

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you got a warning telling about using master for the inital branch, feel free to follow it, but its just a warning and won’t harm anything. If you got another error, go back and make sure that 1. you are in the correct directory, 2. that you haven’t already initalized that directory or one of the parent directories.
If all else fails, double check that your installation method was successful with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git -v</code>, and if not try to install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> again.</p>

<p>You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code> to see the status of the repo. 
This is a helpful command that will tell you what branch you are on, and shows all the files in the directory and which stage they are in.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/git_status_untracked.png" alt="Showing Git Status: Untracked Files" /></p>

<p>Next we need to tell <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> to track all the files. We can do this individually with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add hello_world.txt goodbye.txt</code> or you can use the shortcut to add all files in the current directory.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> just means add everything in the current directory. Once done, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code> will update letting you know everything is ready to be commited.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/imgs/git_status_new.png" alt=" Showing Updated Git Status: Staged files " /></p>

<p>And the final step is to tell <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> to save all the changes in a checkpoint for you. 
This can be done with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git commit -m "Relevant Message"
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>For the message since this is the first one <strong><em>Inital Commit</em></strong> works, but for all future commits, I recommend that you make something that concisely explains the changes that are being made.</p>

<p>Each time we want to save the current state of the repo we need to add all relevant files (most of the time you just add everything with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add .</code>) and then commit them with a relevant message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "Important message"</code></p>

<h2 id="common-errors-and-hiccups">Common Errors and Hiccups</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Initalizing a git repo on your whole Computer (or your home directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advanced-topics-in-git">Advanced Topics in Git</h2>
<p>We covered a lot today, thankfully, that is most of the important things you need. 
However, there are a few advanced topics that I do think are useful to know, even though you might not use them a bunch:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>: I use this the most on the list. This allows you to tell git to ignore specific files. This is super useful if you have a file that contains any sensative information (e.g., SECRETE_KEYS, Identifiable Subject data, etc.).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git diff </code>: a function to specifically see what has changed line by line since the last commit</li>
</ul>

<p>Might not need since there is more to come and this was the warmup.</p>
