Virtual Environments f strings Type Hints Exceptions: Logging Asynchronous Code References Virtual Environmnts f Strings Type hints Exceptions Logging Asynchronous Code &lt;/aside&gt; Takeaways [Estimated Read Time 20 mins] In this blog you will learn the basics of Git and GitHub/GitLab: By the end you will know the 4 stages of the git process All the commands relevant to initalizing and working with a git project Set up your first Git repository Set up your first online repository (via either GitHub or GitLab) Be able to collaborate with any other scientist using Git Prerequisites: None; though it may be helpful to skim through the Command Line (Bash/zsh) post first. Reproducible Code adding nonsense text fix except: Apparently I need more PUrple to purple this purple:was Freeze a Packages! pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt Virtual Environments Virtual Environments are a mechanism used to prevent dependency issues across your python project. There are several mechanisms for implementing virtual environments: Anaconda environments with conda create virtualenv with vewrapper pipenv pyenv For beginners, I would say anaconda environments are the easiest to use. So I would recommend using those, and switching to one of the others if the project needs it because (conda environments can take a lot of space and are quite heavy). After installing (you can use homebrew brew install --cask anaconda or download from the website), you can create a conda env with the following command: conda create -n NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT python=VERSION_NUMBER then you just activate the environment with: conda activate NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT now everything that you install will be completely isolated from the rest of your python environments so you don’t need to worry about dependency incompatabilities. To leave the environment just use: conda deactivate Using the builtin virutalenv you can use: python3 -m venv name_of_virtual_env # Creation . name_of_virtual_env/bin/activate # Activation f strings When first learning how to handle strings in pythong you will likely learn the % sign strategy. This is woefully outdated so as you progress you will soon learn the .format method, which was introduced in python 3.0. However this is also no longer the best way to deal with strings. The modern way to deal with strings in python are with f strings. The are far more readable and allow flexability that is simiply not available in the other methods. They are super simple to use. Anytime you have a string, simply have to add a f to the beginning, then you can use there magic. To print a variable, you can simplely place them inside curly braces {}. numb = 3 txt = f&quot;My favorite number is {numb}&quot; print(txt) As you can see, this is so much easier to read what is being expressed in the string. But the fun doesn’t stop here, you also get a ton of useful formatting feature as well. For example, you can automatically round numbers or even print large numbers with commas to separate them for easier readability. pi = 3.14159 dec_txt = f&quot;Pi is often rounded to {pi:.2f} # colon indicates formating stuff. period indicates formating decimals print(dec_txt) # Output: Pi is often rounded to 3.14 million = 1_000_000 # You can also use underscores to help clarify large numbers mill_txt = f&quot;I can count to {million:,} print(mill_txt) Output: I can count to 1,000,000 full details below: f&#39;{value:{width}.{precision}}&#39; where: value is any expression that evaluates to a number width specifies the number of characters used in total to display, but if value needs more space than the width specifies then the additional space is used. precision indicates the number of characters used after the decimal point f-strings can do so much more for formatting and readability, but I will just highlight to more things. First you can run any python code inside the {} so you can do f&quot;{3+3} to get &quot;6&quot; or f”{COLOR.lower()} to get color`. The other neat feature is you can set things to be a certain size: greet=&quot;hi&quot; f&quot;{greet:_^10}&quot; Output: ____hi____ Type Hints Type hints are a tool that can be used in python to improve readability and expectations of code input and output for functions and classes. With type hints you specify the type each argument requires/expects as well as the expected output type. def add(a: float, b: float=3) -&gt; float: return(a + b) In this simiple example, you see that both arguments are expected to be floats and the second argument even has a default value of 3. Finally, the expected output is as float. Importantly, python does not actually check to confirm the types are as hinted. This is only to make it easier to understand how to properly use the script and/or function. You can use all the primative types for hints: int str float bool bytes list[int or str]: As of 3.9+ otherwise need to import: from typing import List dict: As of 3.9+ or need import: from typing import Dict set: As of 3.9+ or need import: from typing import Set tuple: As of 3.9+ or need import: from typing import Tuple Note: For all imports you need to change the type hint to capitalize the first letter when using them in functions. For more infromation about type hints such as other use cases, using special type hints, or using custom type hints see this post. Exceptions: An exception is a point in the code where an error occured. All exceptions have a description of what when wrong as well as a Traceback of where the exception was encountered. There is a list of common exceptions as well as the hierarchy is on the python website Some common exceptions include: SyntaxError: As described, you messed up the syntax. You will get this a lot when starting out. ValueError: When the value is incorrect like square rooting a negative number. FileNotFound: You guessed it, either the file does not exist OR you spelled it wrong. TypeError: You used the incorrect type, like adding strings and integers. IndexError: Index outside the range of the array. Whenever possible you should use the builtin exceptions but you can create you own custom ones when necessary. To use exceptions in your code you want to mimic the following structure: try: # code that will be attempted first except e as ValueError: # Code that will run when the specific expection is encountered, you can have multiple of these to handle different exceptions differently. else: # Additionally code that should be run if it is successful finally: # Addition code that should be run regardless if it encountered an exception or not. Logging When you first start using python and you want to test/debug your code, then you like just add print statements to your code. Well that is not the proper way to do it. A much much better way is to use the built in logging Asynchronous Code There are often parts of code that can take a long time to complete, say running a web request. Each web request is independent of one another meaning that the output of one does not affect the other. In these cases you can use the asyncio package to run multiple web request asynchronously. This can speed up the program quite significantly. import asyncio For more information, you can check out this video or this blog post.

<h3 id="freeze-a-packages">Freeze a Packages!</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="virtual-environments">Virtual Environments</h3>

<p>Virtual Environments are a mechanism used to prevent dependency issues across your python project. 
There are several mechanisms for implementing virtual environments:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html" title="Conda environments">Anaconda environments</a> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conda create</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/" title="Virtual Env">virtualenv</a> with <a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" title="Virtual Wrapper">vewrapper</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv" title="Pipenv Python Dev for Humans">pipenv</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv" title="Pyenv for simple VE in python">pyenv</a>
For beginners, I would say <a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html" title="Conda environments">anaconda environments</a> are the easiest to use. 
So I would recommend using those, and switching to one of the others if the project needs it because (conda environments can take a lot of space and are quite heavy).</li>
</ul>

<p>After installing (you can use homebrew <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install --cask anaconda</code> or download from the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution" title="Anaconda">website</a>), you can create a <a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html" title="Conda environments"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conda env</code></a> with the following command:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>conda create <span class="nt">-n</span> NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT <span class="nv">python</span><span class="o">=</span>VERSION_NUMBER
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then you just activate the environment with:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>conda activate NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>now everything that you install will be completely isolated from the rest of your python environments so you don’t need to worry about dependency incompatabilities.
To leave the environment just use:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>conda deactivate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using the builtin virutalenv you can use:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 <span class="nt">-m</span> venv name_of_virtual_env <span class="c"># Creation</span>
<span class="nb">.</span> name_of_virtual_env/bin/activate <span class="c"># Activation</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="f-strings">f strings</h2>

<p>When first learning how to handle strings in pythong you will likely learn the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> sign strategy. This is woefully outdated so as you progress you will soon learn the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.format</code> method, which was introduced in python <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.0</code>. However this is also no longer the best way to deal with strings. 
The modern way to deal with strings in python are with <a href="https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/" title="Real Python: f strings"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f strings</code></a>.
The are far more readable and allow flexability that is simiply not available in the other methods.</p>

<p>They are super simple to use. 
Anytime you have a string, simply have to add a f to the beginning, then you can use there magic. 
To print a variable, you can simplely place them inside curly braces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{}</code>.</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">numb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="n">txt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">"My favorite number is </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">numb</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">"</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">txt</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, this is so much easier to read what is being expressed in the string.
But the fun doesn’t stop here, you also get a ton of useful formatting feature as well.
For example, you can automatically <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45310389" title="SO: f Strings round">round numbers</a> or even print <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/07Pxa3TbQc4?feature=share" title="Python Engineer: f Strings large numbers">large numbers with commas</a> to separate them for easier readability.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pi = 3.14159
dec_txt = f"Pi is often rounded to {pi:.2f} #  colon indicates formating stuff. period indicates formating decimals
print(dec_txt) # Output: Pi is often rounded to 3.14
million = 1_000_000 # You can also use underscores to help clarify large numbers
mill_txt = f"I can count to {million:,}
print(mill_txt) Output: I can count to 1,000,000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>full details <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50340297" title="SO: f Strings round Detailed">below</a>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">'</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="si">:{</span><span class="n">width</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">precision</span><span class="si">}}</span><span class="s">'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> is any expression that evaluates to a number</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width</code> specifies the number of characters used in total to display, but if value needs more space than the width specifies then the additional space is used.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">precision</code> indicates the number of characters used after the decimal point</li>
</ul>

<p>f-strings can do so much more for formatting and readability, but I will just highlight to more things. 
First you can run any python code inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{}</code> so you can do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f"{3+3}</code> to get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"6" or </code>f”{COLOR.lower()}<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> to get </code>color`. 
The other neat feature is you can set things to be a certain <a href="https://youtu.be/dvqFNOhNIjM" title="Arjan Codes: f Strings Set size">size</a>:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">greet</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"hi"</span>
<span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">greet</span><span class="si">:</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">"</span> <span class="n">Output</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">____hi____</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="type-hints">Type Hints</h2>

<p>Type hints are a tool that can be used in python to improve readability and expectations of code input and output for functions and classes. With type hints you specify the type each argument requires/expects as well as the expected output type.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this simiple example, you see that both arguments are expected to be floats and the second argument even has a default value of 3. 
Finally, the expected output is as float. 
Importantly, python does not actually check to confirm the types are as hinted. 
This is only to make it easier to understand how to properly use the script and/or function. 
You can use all the primative types for hints:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bytes</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list[int or str]</code>: As of 3.9+ otherwise need to import: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">from typing import List</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dict</code>: As of 3.9+ or need import: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">from typing import Dict</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set</code>: As of 3.9+ or need import: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">from typing import Set</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tuple</code>: As of 3.9+ or need import: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">from typing import Tuple</code></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: For all imports you need to change the type hint to capitalize the first letter when using them in functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For more infromation about type hints such as other use cases, using special type hints, or using custom type hints see this <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html" title="Type hints cheatsheet">post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions:</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://youtu.be/nlCKrKGHSSk" title="Socratica: Exceptions">exception</a> is a point in the code where an error occured.
All exceptions have a description of what when wrong as well as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Traceback</code> of where the exception was encountered. 
There is a list of common exceptions as well as the hierarchy is on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy" title="Python Exception Hierarchy">python website</a>
Some common exceptions include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SyntaxError</code>: As described, you messed up the syntax. You will get this a lot when starting out.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueError</code>: When the value is incorrect like square rooting a negative number.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileNotFound</code>: You guessed it, either the file does not exist <strong><em>OR</em></strong> you spelled it wrong.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TypeError</code>: You used the incorrect type, like adding strings and integers.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexError</code>: Index outside the range of the array.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever possible you should use the builtin <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy" title="Python Exception Hierarchy">exceptions</a> but you can create you own custom ones when necessary.</p>

<p>To use exceptions in your code you want to mimic the following structure:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># code that will be attempted first
</span><span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nb">ValueError</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># Code that will run when the specific expection is encountered, you can have multiple of these to handle different exceptions differently. 
</span><span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span> 
    <span class="c1"># Additionally code that should be run if it is successful
</span><span class="k">finally</span><span class="p">:</span> 
    <span class="c1"># Addition code that should be run regardless if it encountered an exception or not.
</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>

<p>When you first start using python and you want to test/debug your code, then you like just add print statements to your code.
Well that is not the proper way to do it. 
A much much better way is to use the built in <a href="https://youtu.be/g8nQ90Hk328" title="Socratica: Logging"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logging</code></a></p>

<h2 id="asynchronous-code">Asynchronous Code</h2>

<p>There are often parts of code that can take a long time to complete, say running a web request. Each web request is independent of one another meaning that the output of one does not affect the other. In these cases you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code> package to run multiple web request asynchronously. This can speed up the program quite significantly.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">asyncio</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more information, you can check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/2IW-ZEui4h4" title="Arjan Codes: Asynchronous Code with Asyncio">video</a> or this <a href="https://realpython.com/python-async-features/" title="Real Python: asyncio">blog post</a>.</p>
