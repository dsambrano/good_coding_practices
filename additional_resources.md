Still looking for more?!?! Here are a few youtube channels and blog posts that I trust and have served as a great resource for a variety of languages and principles:

One cautionary tale, especially if you have already reviewed a few tutorials.
DO NOT LOOK FOR MORE!
You want to avoid tutorial hell at all cost.
After one, two at the absolute most, tutorials on a topic, just try to do a project with that.
You will NEVER, and I repeat NEVER, feel confident enough to start by looking/watching/reading tutorials.
That is not how coding works; its much more like math.
The only way to improve is to do it; try things out, fail, see what works.
This is the only way to improve.

With that out of the way, if you just wanted to see other places to explore new topics/find some cool resources check out these.
I have personal viewed all of them and can say each are really helpful for different styles/people.
