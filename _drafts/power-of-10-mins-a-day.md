The powrr of ten minutes:
Over the last 30 days I I deleted my social media apps on phone (link) so I was looking for things to do with time

And I bought a rubix cube and every morning I woke up and just tried it for ten minutes. It only took me a X when you break it down thats only XX, there is no way I would have achieved this if I did had done it consecutively. 

Coding is the same way, if you are just starting out or really trying to improve, you cant expect to make nice improvements going have al1 day a week. But rather, you need to make consistency a priority. Whatever you can do 4-7 times a week should be your goal. Whether thats 10 mins or 2 hours a day. Make sure you put in the days. And you will see marked gains

Ten mins: the power is even if you stick to a 10 mins schedule, there will be days that you are on a row/in flow state and crank out 30 minutes. This is great for your learning and youll see how you really can fit it into your schedule 


It about formining a habit, you should make it a priority, even if its only 5 mins gets some time in at least 4-7 times a week
