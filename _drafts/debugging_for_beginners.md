maybe a whol error handling section
1. REAd the error, I am not joking a lot of peole dont read them
2. Try to understand what it is telling you, again for some reason people skip this step.
3. if you still dont understand google the error
4. Some good examples site to seek out are stackoverflow
5. If you are still stuck, first try rephrasing your search and to see if you can solve the problem
6. If you are still stuck, find somone and ask for help. It is important to struggle, that is how you learn, but you dont want to be stuck on a problem for days just because you didnt know how to google it correctly. Use you social resources, people are often quite willing to help if you ask, but for you got to put in the effort
