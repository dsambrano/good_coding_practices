## Raspberry Pi

[Raspberry Pi][raspbery-pi] is a foundation who's goal is to allow everyone access to computers and an environment to learn to code.
To that goal they have an amazing $35 [Raspberry Pi 4][raspbery-pi-4] (unfortunately 45 because of the supply shortage), microcomputer.
That is, its a computer the size of your credit card has an entire Linux OS on it.
They are amazing, I have used them in the past to make robots, create a server, and make smark devices in my home, but since they have a full fledge OS, you could use them a general purpose computer.
Of course, since they are only $35 bucks, they are not the fastest things, but if you just to need occasionally look something up online or are trying to show a young one how to use a computer they are create general purpose computers for those situations as well.
Robot enthusiasts, should also check out [Arduino][], which is a company with a specific goal but specifically geared towards robotics (though I still prefer the Raspberry Pi because you can use python, where arduino products require you to use C/C++).

Raspberry pi has several variations.
The standard model is the [Raspberry Pi 4][raspbery-pi-4], which ranges from $35 - $100 depending on the specs. 
The [Raspberry Pi Zero][pi0] is a light weight version about the size of a stick of gum and runs for about and goes for $10 to $20 depending on specs.
Finally, there is the [Raspberry Pi Pico][raspbery-pi-pico], which is even smaller and goes for $4 to $6 depending on the specs.
The Pico is a little different; however, since its not a micro computer, but rather a microcontroller.
This means the Pico doesn't have an OS, so you can't check your email or browse the web.
A microcontroller is just designed to repeatedly do a task.
These can be designed to sense changes in the environment and do something (mini robot).
For example, you might use one to measure the water level for your plants soil and change an LEDs color depending on the amount.

Honestly, let that sink in, you can get a full computer for as cheap as $35, and if you are willing to compromize all the way down to $10.
You can mess with it til your hearts content and if it breaks, that is totally fine!
One thing I forgot to mention is that these are also quite effecient, so they are not going to be wasting a lot of energy.
In fact, you can even run them off of solar power (though, its far more effective on the pico and zero than the standard model)!
> **Note**: Solar power is far more effective for the pico and zero because they consume less energy.

To some, Raspberry Pis are amazing little electronic computers that can be used as a low cost way to teach electronic/computers/coding or just as a general hobby project. 
No matter what you choose you are bound to have a blast trying things out.
The rest of this post will help you get started by showing you how set up 
<!-- Need to decide if I want this to be setup RPi or basic first electronic curcuit (probs both but two separate ones) -->
So once you learn the basics from this post, you will have the foundation you need for all the other future RPi tutorials


## Electronic Basics

So to get you started you are going to need to now a little bit

Voltage:
Current:
Ampre:

Postitive: typically black for wired electronics (Not true for wires in HOMES)
Negative: typically red for wired electronics

Anode: Positive (usually longer side for LEDs)
Cathode: Negative (usually shorter side for LEDs)

Resistor: (note the standard colors)
