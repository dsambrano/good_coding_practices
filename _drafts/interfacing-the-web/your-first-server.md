## What is a Server?

A server is a computer with a dedicated task.
As opposed to your desktop, which can allow you do anything you decided for the day, a server focuses on one thing.
Some common examples are a website server, which hosts a website and reponds to users as they request pages from your site.
Another commone one, is a database server, which stores your data in a very effecient way and allows you to access it.
And finally we have cloud servers which can offer storage (Dropbox/Google Drive) or computational resources (AWS, GCP, Asure).

At the core, just like any script a server takes in inputs performs so automated action and returns back some output.
The main differences is that when you run a script its on your own computer, and when you use a server its over the network (even its its a local network).

### Your First Server

Now that we know what a server is, we are going to create one.
But we are going to make it on your own computer, and you will access it from your broswer (like I said above, a server gets accessed via the network even if its local).

## Ways to connect to a server

The easiest way to connect to a server is to go to the corresponded website, when you go to a website by typeing `https://blog.dsambrano.com`, your browser is actually sending an HTTP request to that server.
You can see this in action if you open up the developer tools on your favorite browser
