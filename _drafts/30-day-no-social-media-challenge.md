30 day challenge:
I genuinely started seeing withdrawal symptoms after two days. I really struggled with the temptation and “boredom” i don’t think it was actually boredom, I think my brain was doing whatever it could to get the fix. Just like a true addict.


# Focus
I realized how social media was completely ruied myability to focus. Once I stopped for the first XX I would be thinking about a topic and my mind would wonder at such an extreme pace. It was difficult but will a little practice I was able to turn that extra mental energy into productivity 

#boredom
I didn't realize how much I used media to just fill time. Removing it in some instances just allowed me to focus on the topic at hand but in others I felt bored. But after remebering about the benefits of boredom. I figure out how to use it to my advantage. I was able to use that extra brain power to actually focus on tasks that were difficult or challenging. I would solve things much quicker. It also helped me to do things I had been trying for years. For example, I finally was able to solve a rubic cube. I started working out everyday. All because before I would just been sitting/laying down mindlessly scrolling. 

#creaticity

My creativity exploded  in response to not having all that energy consumed by social media

# habits
You notice that a random times you would click on the spot where the apps used to be. This is where I truly realized how bad the addiction was. Its only been a second and I’m already reaching for my next fix. 

# sleep

Improved dramatically  specially being able to go to sleep(i was super concerned cuz I thought I wouldn’t be able to go to sleep without YT, if you just read a book something instead you will fall right to sleep. You may have different success but this was helpful
