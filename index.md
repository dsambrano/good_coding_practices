# Welcome!

Welcome to my Coding Blog!
I am your Coding Buddy, and I plan to share all the things I learned about Coding (and Technology) over the past 10 years.
I typically put out a few posts a week, so make sure to come back soon to see what's new.
If you are looking for something in particular, check out the various topics I cover in the Nav bar on top.
I also have posts separated by difficulty level if you are interested.
Don't forget to share these posts if you find them helpful!
