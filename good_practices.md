## Takeaways

[Estimated Read Time XX mins]

In this blog you will learn a variety of helpful Coding Practices to improve the readability efficacy of your code. These are in no particular order and some may some obvious, while others less so. If you already know why its useful/already implement it, feel free to jump around 

Prerequisites:
- None

## Imports First

## No Hard Coding, Ever!

## Separate Config File

## Modular Functions

## Modular Code

## Write Code for Humans not Machines

## Will you Remember this in XX Months?

## Use a Syntax Style

e.g., pep8, google style guide, black, etc. 

- Using caps for static variables, use variables, never hard code, dont repeat code, functionalize, abstraction

## Design Strategy

Using a Design Pattern (not necessarily Design Pattern but there is also Solid from uncle bob)

## Composition and Inheritence

Composition over inheritence


## Unit Tests


## Test Driven Development


## Automation

Automate as much of your development (and testing) stack as possible

## Dependency Injection / Inversion


## Conclusion

This is a great start and will significantly improve your codings skill but there are always more things you can do. Once you feel like you got the hang of these tips, move onto the [part 2][good_practice2.md] where you will learn more about automatation, testing code, working in a team, and much more. This is a intermediate section and will take your code to the next level. Some of it is beyond what is necessary for scientific applications, but you will need all of it if you decide to go into industry.
