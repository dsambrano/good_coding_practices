# To Do List:

- Figure out the ordering of the posts? (Seems like naming order but New Post does not follow that)
- Figure out why excerpts are not showing for my new ones. (Probably because its a list, if so just add the <!--more--> option)
- Move the `_includes` and the `_layouts` folders from the theme over (symlink with GH?)
- Show Categories for the posts above the excerts
- Make dark mode (ideally with JS so it can be togglable)
- Fix/Configure the categories to be Consistent across all of them
