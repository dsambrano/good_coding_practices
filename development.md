# To Do List:

- Figure out the ordering of the posts? (Seems like naming order but New Post does not follow that)
- Figure out why excerpts are not showing for my new ones. (Probably because its a list, if so just add the <!--more--> option)
- Move the `_includes` and the `_layouts` folders from the theme over (symlink with GH?)
- Show Categories for the posts above the excerts
- Make dark mode (ideally with JS so it can be togglable)
- Fix/Configure the categories to be Consistent across all of them

- Add a `_data` folder to store topics, authors, etc. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/
- Fix Front Matter to include time, difficulty, new data folder, YT_links (if applicable) and takeaways
  - CSS for difficulty
  - Home and each page for time
  - post layout to adjust the template to have the takeaways look the same
  - post layout for the new data created and the Yt links

- allow images
- See if you can use variables in CSS
- Create related posts probably in Front Matter
- Investigate collectsion as a solution to related posts/the order problem in the yaml

# Solution 

Solved the Clustering (for the perma link)
- Move everything to a tag then have the groupings be folder clusters exclusively
- Make a new Page about the clusters which for the layout it only selects the clusters in normal ordering
- Add page to do the same thing for the sample and symlink it from code samples move all to samples folder and then symlink


Use this for inspiration especially on the Lesson the home page and what really counts as beginner
Also see the home page for a python to get some infor about a setup
finally look at the index.html file for image ideas on the posts/organization strategies
