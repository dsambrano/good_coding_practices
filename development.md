# To Do List:

- Figure out the ordering of the posts? (Seems like naming order but New Post does not follow that)
- Figure out why excerpts are not showing for my new ones. (Probably because its a list, if so just add the <!--more--> option)
- Move the `_includes` and the `_layouts` folders from the theme over (symlink with GH?)
- Show Categories for the posts above the excerts
- Make dark mode (ideally with JS so it can be togglable)
- Fix/Configure the categories to be Consistent across all of them

- Add a `_data` folder to store topics, authors, etc. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/
- Fix Front Matter to include time, difficulty, new data folder, YT_links (if applicable) and takeaways
  - CSS for difficulty
  - Home and each page for time
  - post layout to adjust the template to have the takeaways look the same
  - post layout for the new data created and the Yt links

- allow images
- See if you can use variables in CSS
- Create related posts probably in Front Matter
- Investigate collectsion as a solution to related posts/the order problem in the yaml
