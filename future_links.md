This file is used to note where links need to be added when future posts are created. 
Currently organized by the post that needs to be updated, but probably would be better to flip this. 
Also might even be better if I move to having this as a data file, that way I can have them all be updated in a single place.
One issue with this; however, is that its not clear if I can read in the post name from the datafile and have that name be passed to the link function. So this needs testing. If it does work this would be quite helpful, I would just need to make an underconstruction page for the default link, until it has been updated. 

Future links:
- Productivity: 
  - Add customizing terminal link to customization section (there are two. One in the first paragraph and one in the last)
  - Add code snippets link to the t-test example
  - Need to add video illustrating the tiling window manager (template already there)
  - Need to add images with fancy colors for terminal in Customizing section

- Python Best Practices:
  - Package Mangager to the virtual environments section, replace homebrew to help them install.

- CLIs
  - Dotfiles link when talking about custimation
  - probs should add the CV one as well
  - Terminal Customization There is a secion in know your os that wants a link for mac users. (Relatedly need to make it clearn ohmyzsh works on linux too)
  - Terminal customiation there needs add section to package managers
  - Linux Linux Linux: Should add a full linux one, a what is a distro, what is a DE, how to choose a distro, and ...
  - For Termina customization I hint about talking about Tiling Window Managers
