## What Even is a Computational Model

A computational Model is just a mathematical equation, serving as a hypothesis, for some psychological phenomenon. We use models all the time. Most commonly with the linear model in regression. A computational model just adds flexibility in that it is not predefined so you can adjust it to your specific situations. So you can make allow it have some non linearity or have only partial linearity.
