## Why Should You Use A Computational Model

<!-- First, schematic based models do not provide specific hypotheses, making them difficult (if not impossible) to falsify.
For example, each box on the schematic often represents a plethora of variables.
In the EIC model, there is box representing the characteristics of the decision maker (e.g., preferences and personality), which influences both one’s current emotions as well as the utility calculation of the options.
Undoubtedly, the authors do not imply every characteristic impacts one’s affective state and utility calculations, but which ones are important, and which can be ignored, are not specified.
Perhaps more importantly, because the particular variables of interest are not specified, one would need to test all possible characteristics to falsify the model’s hypothesis.

The second shortcoming of schematic based models is, by design, they do not make specific hypotheses about the magnitude of effects between related components.
For example, in the EIC model one’s current emotion influences the evaluations they make, which in turn affects their choices.
But how much does one’s affect impact their evaluations and what is the nature of that relationship?
Is it linear, the more intense the emotion the larger the effect, or is it based on a threshold, where any emotion intensity after the threshold will have a similar effect and any emotion below the threshold will not impact the evaluation at all?
Schematic based models do not provide this information.
Importantly, the EIC model, was hypothesized as general purpose model and never intended to address these concerns.
Particularly because the field was still at a state where we needed to identify the affective factors involved in the decision making process (the time when schematic based models are most effective).
However, I believe the next major leap to improve our understanding of the relationship between affect and decision making will require us to address these shortcomings of schematic based models.
One solution to this problem is to use a computational model for how people make decisions.

In addition to several practical benefits (e.g., ensuring your trial space is sufficiently wide and simulations), computational models address the limitations of schematic based models.
Since a computational model specifies all the variables that are hypothesized to impact one’s choice, anyone who has the model can make predictions outside the context for which the original experiment was developed.
For example, if an experiment includes lotteries with win rate of 25%, 50%, and 75%, one could use the model to hypothesize how any person would choose if the win rate was 10%.
They need only supply the arguments for a specific lottery as well as person’s parameter estimates.
Crucially, if new experimental data stands in conflict with the a priori predictions of the model, then the model is inaccurate (or at the very least incomplete).
There is a clear falsifiable hypothesis even outside the context of the original experiment.
Additionally, since a computational model is essentially a mathematical formula, the parameters provide clear, mathematically define impacts on the outcome, and the impact can be interpreted before any experiment or parameter estimation.
By design, the model’s formula describes the magnitude for the effects, whether they be linear, exponential, etc.
Together, these features help improved the scientific discourse around emotion and decision making.

## What Even is a Computational Model

A computational Model is just a mathematical equation, serving as a hypothesis, for some psychological phenomenon. We use models all the time. Most commonly with the linear model in regression. A computational model just adds flexibility in that it is not predefined so you can adjust it to your specific situations. So you can make allow it have some non linearity or have only partial linearity.
