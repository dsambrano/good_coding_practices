## Apperance is Important

<!-- excerpt-start -->
Change your Default Terminal Colors **NOW**! 

> The happier you are when you look at your terminal the happier you will be when coding. 
More Happy means more coding. 
More Coding means more practice. 
More practice means Great Coder!

This same principle applies for all text editors/IDEs (integrated developer environment) by the way. 
So it sounds like a joke, but seriously take some time to have a nice looking coding environment. 

In order to change them, you should be able to create a default profile for most terminal emulators and change the color scheme, opacity, font, etc. 


## Know your OS

Knowing what OS you are on is super important as the commands change across them. 
Luckily Linux and MacOS share most of the commands because they use the same shell (you have probably heard of `bash` before). 
This is especially useful to know, because all servers and super computers/computing clusters all run Linux, so having familiarity with the shell via using MacOS is very valuable. 
In contrast, Windows uses CMD or Powershell which has a differnt syntax and command list. 
Luckily for you, there is a project to give Windows `bash` commands called [gitbash][], and I highly reccomand you use that to be able to follow along. 
Most of the time if you get some CLI (command line interface) code it will assume bash so its just a good skill to have. 

Speaking of `bash` it stands for Bourne Again SHell. 
However, recently (since around 2019 or so) both MacOS and many Linux distros switched the default shell to `zsh` (or The Z shell). 
This is, for the most part, entirely compatible with `bash` except that it adds some nice quality of life improvements that are beyond the scope of this blog, but feel free to explore on your own. 
I will say that for Mac users specifically, I would reccomend you check out [iTerm2][] as an alternative to the standard terminal and [oh my zsh][ohmyzsh] to add some amazing color theming for some general improvements. 
But of course this is not necessary. *Mac users, I will be uploading an install script to match my own setup. And a link to it will be updated here.*

## Knowing Your Way Around with `bash`

First, thing open up your terminal. 
If you are using MacOS or Linux you can expect it to look something like this:

```
NEED to show example can be replaced with an image
```
Explain what each piece means

There are three really important commands to know to navigate around the your file system:
- `pwd`: Print working Directory
- `cd`: Change Directory
- `ls`: List (Contents)

One analogy for these commands is imaging you are on a random street in a US city that you don't know. 
The `pwd` command is like looking up your current address. It will tell you were you are. 
The `ls` command would be like looking around the street (or on your map) to see what restruants are on the street. 
And `cd` would be like moving to a new location. 
In keeping the analogy, you can't just move to an arbritrary new street because you don't know this city. 
Instead you have to give precise directions either from were you are currently or relative to some clearly visable space (say a big colorful building you can see from anywhere in the city). 
Now let's see these in action.

### `pwd`

```shell
~ pwd 
/user/deshawn
```
![pwd](/assets/imgs/pwd.png)

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/pwd.png" alt="pwd" width="150"/> -->


the `pwd` command return where were are currently looking and is equivalent to `getwd()` in r or `os.getcwd()` in python. 
As you can see I am in my users home directory. 
This is a super common place, so it has a shortcut that can be accessed with `~` called the tilde and its above tab and to the left of the 1 on the keyboard. 
<br><br>

> **Hint**: Capitalization matters so make sure you keep that in mind. 
I personally always have my folders names lowercase to make this easier. 
Simlarly spaces require an espace `\`, so I also avoid spaces in repo names (typically using `_`'s.

### `cd`

```shell
~ cd Desktop
~/Desktop
```

![cd](/assets/imgs/cd.png)

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/cd.png" alt="cd" width="150"/> -->

The `cd` command allows you to change your current working directory similar to `os.setwd` in R and `os.chdir()` in python. 
Unlike most programming languages you are probably familiar with in `bash` you don't have parentheses. 
The arguments are just placed after the command separated by a space. 
For more info about the structure of `bash` scripting [see below][bash-structure]

> **Hint**: Before finishing the location you want to go, you can hit tab to autocomplete the argument. 
This is invaluable and will save so much time to working memeory capcity so definitely try it out. 
Also for `zsh` users you can even type out partial directories and have your shell complete e.g., `cd De/git` will give `cd` to my `Desktop/github_repo` directory. 


### `ls`

```shell
➜  ls git_repos/good_coding_practices
README.md         git.md            imgs              modeling.md       pwd.png
cli.md            good_practices.md markdown.md       productivity.md   python.md
```

![ls](/assets/imgs/ls.png)

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/ls.png" alt="pwd" width="650"/> -->


The `ls` lists all directories and files inside the specified directory (defaults to your current working directory if no directory path is specified). 
I have mine set up to give different colors to folder, which you can ignore for now. 
>**Hint**: This command works for me because I have a folder on my computer called `git_repos/good_coding_practices`, but you probably do not. You can either make one to follow along or even better use a different folder to see the files there. 
But separate from that I will teach you about the optional argument `-a`:

![lsa](/assets/imgs/ls-a.png)
<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/ls-a.png" alt="pwd" width="650"/> --> 

`ls -a` (a for all) shows all hidden files and directories in addition to the nonhidden ones. 
A hidden file is just one that starts with a `.`. 
In out case, the `.git` folder is one example. 


## The form of Commands

A command is just a mini program that executes when you call it from  a terminal. 
But in order to best understand terminal commands its useful to know how they are structured. 
Every command has 3 basic (potential) parts. 
The command itself, any options you can apply, and finally any arguments. 

As you saw above with the `cd` command, we had an argument (the new directory to change to). 
Again the argument is separated only by a space (no parenteses as you may be used to from other programming languages) and any additional arugment is also separated by a space. 
For the `ls` command we learned about the `-a` option again separated by a space. Options in bash start with a `-`. 
It is common practice for single letter options to have a single `-` and full word arguments have two `--`. 
Now that you know how commands are structure the next couple sections will list a bunch of useful basic commands before we end by showing you a way to learn the ins and outs of a command (like its options) and how to find a comand to perform a task you suspect exists. 

### Creating/Deleting/Removing New Folders and Files

For all the commands the relevant arguments will be in `[]`

- `mkdir`: Make Directory (folder) [`name_of_folder_to_make`; use the `-p` (for make parent directories) if you want to make multiple nested folders simultaneously]
- `touch`: Make an Empty File [`name_of_file_to_make`]
- `cp`: Copy [`name_of_file_to_copy`; `name_of_location_to_copy_to`]
- `mv`: Move [`name_of_file_to_move`; `name_of_location_to_move_to`; can also be used to change a files name if you move it to the same location with a new name]
- `rm`: Remove a file [`name_of_file_to_remove`]

### Viewing Contents and Editing Files

- `nano`: A simple to use text editor. You will likely hear about other editors like `vim` or `emacs`. Both are really good, but they have a really hard learning curve, so I don't reccomend them when you start out. I personally use `nvim`, which is a modern replacement for `vim`. [`name_of_file_to_edit`]
- `cat`: Concatenate (prints out files contents) [`name_of_file_to_print`]
- `less`: Less (is more... powerful). Useful for printing out really long docs becuse you can scroll through them [`name_of_file_to_print`]
- `more`: More (of the content on screen) Useful for printing out really long docs but not as good as `less` [`name_of_file_to_print`]

## How to Learn About New Commands

These commands are more important to remember because they let you find a command to do perform and actiona as well as learn how to use that command:

- `apropos`: à propos (meaning with regard to). This command allows you to search for all commands the perform function/have anything in their name/description about a topic. [`descriptiion_or_name` you want to search for]
  >***If you only remember one command this is the one to remember***
- `man`: (Pull up the) Manual (for the respective command so you can learn all the options available) [`command` you want to know more about similar to `help()` or `??` in most languages] 

## Further Exploration

As you can imagine, this is just a taste of the command line. You can do so so much more. Hopefully this was just enough to wet your appetite, and make you eager to explore more. One great place to start is with [Modern Unix][munix]. This is a project that has upgrades many of the commands we just talked about to fit with the modern world, (e.g., adding colors, speed, etc.). Another way to speed things up is to make alias which you can write short hand for really long commands.

## Homework

Try to make a new folder called `git_repos` somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. 
Then make `README.md` file (for advanced users try `nano` or `vim` to edit it and say something). 

Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). 
Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure:

```shell
my_first_bash_script/
  |-- analyses/
      |-- plots/
  |-- expriment/
      |-- data/
  |-- lit_review/
  |-- supporting_docs/
      |-- scales/
      |-- irb_docs/  
  |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md
  |-- README.md
```

Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. 
I highly highly reccommend two separate `.md` files. 
The `README` is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). 
In contrast the `DEVELOPMENT` file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project.
Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. 
I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. 
This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable.
