In this blog you will learn the basics of Markdown and Markdown Files. 
These are in no particular order and some parts may seem obvious, while others less so. 
If you already know why its useful/already implement it, feel free to jump around. 

Prerequisites:
- None

## What is Markdown

<!-- excerpt-start -->

Markdown is a markup language. 
It is a super easy way to embedded structure when taking notes or documenting things. 
Markdown files are super common for taking notes, or perhaps most frequently, as `README.md` files for GitHub repos.
This is because it has super simple syntax. 

For example all these blogs were created with Markdown. 
To get started make a make a file name ending in <!-- excerpt-end -->the `.md` extension. 
Now any text you type will have a highlevel markup. 
So if you want to make headers like we have here just put `# Title` then have a line break and all  the text underneath will be in that sub header. 
Similarly, you can create other headers with the following syntax:

```
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6
```

# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6

Basically, Markdown is a way to allow you to focus on the notes or writing process to have a nice clean structure without dealing with the extra headache require to make them look really nice. 
Below are several simple/common things you will want to do in Markdown. 
But for more info visit the [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax). 
Otherwise this post is mainly hear to let you get a sense of what markdown can do and for you enjoy your newfound skill! Don't forget the [Homework](markdown.md#homework)

One final piece of advice, while viewing the `.md` file you won't see all the fancy formatting; however, most modern IDE (e.g., Rstudio, VScode, etc.) have either native or plugin support to allow you to view the full fancy version while typing.

__________________
### Bold and Emphasis
Bold and italics are easy. To use them just add `*` around whatever you want to alter. For example, to **bold** (`**bold**`), *italics* (`*italics*`), ***bold and italics*** (`***bold and italics***`).

### Links (Most Useful?)
This is the feature I use the most. 
Here we can use the following structure for links:

```
[description](link)
```

But when I mean link, I don't just mean a website... no, no, no. 
They can link to any file on your computer as well using its relative path. 
So say we had a Markdown file containing notes. 
I can link to that file from here with the following syntax:

```
I can link to that file from here with the following [syntax](notes.md)
```

But it gets even better, since that is a markdown file I can even link to a specific subsection. 
For example, say their was a subsubsection (level 3 header) titled lottery. 
Then I can specifically link to that with this syntax:

```
Linking to the [lottery section](notes.md#lottery)
```

Of course, since you can link to a file, you can also embed pictures and links.

```

[My personal website](https://dsambrano.com/)

```
![Image Description](/assets/imgs/git_stages.png)
```
![Image Description](/assets/imgs/git_stages.png)
> Note the `!`. Also, you need to have the image in that folder with that name for it to show up. 


## Lists
list are as easy as a dash:
- first 
- second
  - second a
  - second b
- third 
- etc...
  
```
- first 
- second
  - second a
  - second b
- third 
- etc...
```

Numbered list work as well (notice you dont even need to number them correctly):
1. first
1. second
1. third

```
1. first
2. second
3. third
```

Finally, to get fancy formated code you can add ` ` around your text:
` `text` `. For blocks of code just make sure you have 3 of the backticks.
P.S. for the LaTeX fans out there most editors have either native or plugin support for `$` style equations.


## Homework

Create a Markdown file describing all the main scientific/developmental decisions you made on your most recent project. 
For example, why did you select that specific stimulus vs another or why did you choose that framework/database type over another. Why that method?
> **Hint**: Link to relevant artcles or to other markdown files containing notes you made.
