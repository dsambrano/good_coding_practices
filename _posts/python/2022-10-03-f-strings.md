<section class="takeaways">

In this post you will learn some best practices for coding in Python. By the end you will:
- Learn how f-strings work to make clean text in python

Prerequisites:
- Basic/working knowledge of how to write python code. Does not need to be advance, as long as you know how to write and run a script.

## f strings

<!-- excerpt-start -->

When first learning how to handle strings in pythong you will likely learn the `%` sign strategy.
This is woefully outdated so as you progress you will soon learn the `.format` method, which was introduced in python `3.0`.
However this is also no longer the best way to deal with strings (and hasn't been for awhile).
The modern way to deal with strings in python are with [`f strings`][f1].
They are far more readable and allow flexability that is simiply not available in the other methods.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

They are super simple to use. 
Anytime you have a string, you simply have to add a `f` to the beginning, then you can use there magic. 
To print a variable, you can simply place them inside curly braces `{}`. 

```python
numb = 3
txt = f"My favorite number is {numb}"
print(txt) # My favorite number is 3
```

As you can see, this is so much easier to read what is being expressed in the string.
But the fun doesn't stop here, you also get a ton of useful formatting feature as well.
For example, you can automatically [round numbers][f3] or even print [large numbers with commas][f4] to separate them for easier readability. 

```python
pi = 3.14159
# A colon indicates formating stuff: period indicates after the decimal
dec_txt = f"Pi is often rounded to two decimals: {pi:.2f}"
print(dec_txt) üëâÔ∏è 'Pi is often rounded to two decimals: 3.14'


# You can also use underscores to help clarify large numbers
million = 1_000_000
# And then have them printed with commas
mill_txt = f"I can count to {million:,}"
print(mill_txt) üëâÔ∏è I can count to 1,000,000
```

full details [below][f5]:

```python
f'{value:{width}.{precision}}'
```

where:

- `value` is any expression that evaluates to a number
- `width` specifies the number of characters used in total to display, but if value needs more space than the width specifies then the additional space is used.
- `precision` indicates the number of characters used after the decimal point

f-strings can do so much more for formatting and readability, but I will just highlight two more things. 
First you can run any python code inside the `{}` so you can do `f"{3+3}` to get "6" or `f"{'SAMPLE_TEXT'.lower()}"` to get `sample_text`.


The other neat feature is you can set things to be a certain [size][f2], so you van force a string to be surrounded by a character or white space to make sure that it reaches that length.
For example if you wanted to have a string that looks like `____hi____`, you could run:

```python
greet="hi"
print(f"{greet:_^10}") üëâÔ∏è ____hi____
```

Again, you can customize this by changing the `_` for example, if you wanted whitespace, you could delete that character or if you wanted `====hi====`, you could replace it with a `=`.
Similarly if you wanted the text flush left you could replace the `^` with `<` (`hi________`).
And as you might expect, using a `>` means that the text is flush right (`________hi`)

To summary, you can manipulate strings with this structure:

```python
f"{str:{fill}{justify}{length}}"
```
where:

- `str`: is the string you want to manipulate.
- `fill`: is the character you want to fill the empty space, leave black for whitespace.
- `justify`: is the direction you want justified: (for center use `^` for left use `<` for right use `>`).
- `length`: is the total length of the string after adding the `fill` character.
