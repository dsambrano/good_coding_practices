<section class="takeaways">

In this post you will learn some best practices for coding in Python. By the end you will:
- Learn how write readable/usable functions with type hints

Prerequisites:
- Basic/working knowledge of how to write python code. Does not need to be advance, as long as you know how to write and run a script.

## Type Hints

<!-- excerpt-start -->
Type hints are a tool that can be used in python to improve readability and expectations of code input and output for functions and classes. With type hints you specify the type each argument requires/expects as well as the expected output type. 

<!-- excerpt-end -->

```python
def add(a: float, b: float=3) -> float:
    return(a + b)
```

In this simiple example, you see that both arguments are expected to be floats and the second argument even has a default value of 3. 
Finally, the expected output is as float. 
Importantly, python does not actually check to confirm the types are as hinted.
So, you will still need to raise the appropriate exception.
This is only to make it easier to understand how to properly use the script and/or function. 
You can use all the primative types for hints:
- `int`
- `str`
- `float`
- `bool`
- `bytes`
- `list[int or str]`: As of 3.9+ otherwise need to import: `from typing import List`
- `dict`: As of 3.9+ or need import: `from typing import Dict`
- `set`: As of 3.9+ or need import: `from typing import Set`
- `tuple`: As of 3.9+ or need import: `from typing import Tuple`

> **Note**: For all type hints that are imported, you need to change the type hint to capitalize the first letter when using them in functions.

It is important that you are as specific as possible when creating type hints otherwise they are not that useful.
For example, it would be a bad idea to have a `str` type hint if it really could only be `BEGINNER`, `INTERMEDIATE`, and `ADVANCED`.
Instead you should create you own custom type hint.
Luckily, the `Enum` function makes this incredibly easy.

```python
from enum import Enum

class Difficulties(Enum):
    # You can also assign a specific value if needed.
    #     E.g., BEGINNER = 1 # or 'b'
    BEGINNER = auto()
    INTERMEDIATE = auto()
    ADVANCED = auto()

def get_difficulty(diff: Difficulties):
    return(diff.name)

result = get_difficulty(Difficulties.ADVANCED)
print(result) üëâÔ∏è ADVANCED
```

As you can see, type hints make your code much more clear as to what each function/class expects as inputs.
Using them can help others (including your future self after you forgot this project) understand what your functions need to work.
By including them in your code, you will significantly increase your codes readability.
