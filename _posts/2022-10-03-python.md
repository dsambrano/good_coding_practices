## Takeaways

[Estimated Read Time 20 mins]

In this blog you will learn the basics of Git and GitHub/GitLab:
- By the end you will know the 4 stages of the git process
- All the commands relevant to initalizing and working with a git project
- Set up your first Git repository
- Set up your first online repository (via either GitHub or GitLab)
- Be able to collaborate with any other scientist using Git

Prerequisites:
- None; though it may be helpful to skim through the [Command Line (Bash/zsh)](cli.md) post first.
  
## Reproducible Code

<!-- excerpt-start -->

adding nonsense text fix except: Apparently I need more PUrple to purple this purple:was

### Freeze a Packages!

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

### Virtual Environments

Virtual Environments are a mechanism used to prevent dependency issues across your python project. 
There are several mechanisms for implementing virtual environments:
- [Anaconda environments][condaenv] with `conda create`
- [virtualenv][] with [vewrapper][]
- [pipenv][]
- [pyenv][]
For beginners, I would say [anaconda environments][condaenv] are the easiest to use. 
So I would recommend using those, and switching to one of the others if the project needs it because (conda environments can take a lot of space and are quite heavy).

After installing (you can use homebrew `brew install --cask anaconda` or download from the [website][anaconda]), you can create a [`conda env`][condaenv] with the following command:
```bash
conda create -n NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT python=VERSION_NUMBER
```

then you just activate the environment with:
```bash
conda activate NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT
```
now everything that you install will be completely isolated from the rest of your python environments so you don't need to worry about dependency incompatabilities.
To leave the environment just use: 

```bash
conda deactivate
```

Using the builtin virutalenv you can use:

```bash
python3 -m venv name_of_virtual_env # Creation
. name_of_virtual_env/bin/activate # Activation
```

## f strings

When first learning how to handle strings in pythong you will likely learn the `%` sign strategy. This is woefully outdated so as you progress you will soon learn the `.format` method, which was introduced in python `3.0`. However this is also no longer the best way to deal with strings. 
The modern way to deal with strings in python are with [`f strings`][f1].
The are far more readable and allow flexability that is simiply not available in the other methods.

They are super simple to use. 
Anytime you have a string, simply have to add a f to the beginning, then you can use there magic. 
To print a variable, you can simplely place them inside curly braces `{}`. 
```python
numb = 3
txt = f"My favorite number is {numb}"
print(txt)
```

As you can see, this is so much easier to read what is being expressed in the string.
But the fun doesn't stop here, you also get a ton of useful formatting feature as well.
For example, you can automatically [round numbers][f3] or even print [large numbers with commas][f4] to separate them for easier readability. 

```
pi = 3.14159
dec_txt = f"Pi is often rounded to {pi:.2f} #  colon indicates formating stuff. period indicates formating decimals
print(dec_txt) # Output: Pi is often rounded to 3.14
million = 1_000_000 # You can also use underscores to help clarify large numbers
mill_txt = f"I can count to {million:,}
print(mill_txt) Output: I can count to 1,000,000
```

full details [below][f5]:

```python
f'{value:{width}.{precision}}'
```

where:

- `value` is any expression that evaluates to a number
- `width` specifies the number of characters used in total to display, but if value needs more space than the width specifies then the additional space is used.
- `precision` indicates the number of characters used after the decimal point

f-strings can do so much more for formatting and readability, but I will just highlight to more things. 
First you can run any python code inside the `{}` so you can do `f"{3+3}` to get `"6" or `f"{COLOR.lower()}` to get `color`. 
The other neat feature is you can set things to be a certain [size][f2]:
```python
greet="hi"
f"{greet:_^10}" Output: ____hi____
```


## Type Hints

Type hints are a tool that can be used in python to improve readability and expectations of code input and output for functions and classes. With type hints you specify the type each argument requires/expects as well as the expected output type. 

```python
def add(a: float, b: float=3) -> float:
    return(a + b)
```

In this simiple example, you see that both arguments are expected to be floats and the second argument even has a default value of 3. 
Finally, the expected output is as float. 
Importantly, python does not actually check to confirm the types are as hinted. 
This is only to make it easier to understand how to properly use the script and/or function. 
You can use all the primative types for hints:
- `int`
- `str`
- `float`
- `bool`
- `bytes`
- `list[int or str]`: As of 3.9+ otherwise need to import: `from typing import List`
- `dict`: As of 3.9+ or need import: `from typing import Dict`
- `set`: As of 3.9+ or need import: `from typing import Set`
- `tuple`: As of 3.9+ or need import: `from typing import Tuple`

> **Note**: For all imports you need to change the type hint to capitalize the first letter when using them in functions.

For more infromation about type hints such as other use cases, using special type hints, or using custom type hints see this [post][th1].

## Exceptions:

An [exception][e1] is a point in the code where an error occured.
All exceptions have a description of what when wrong as well as a `Traceback` of where the exception was encountered. 
There is a list of common exceptions as well as the hierarchy is on the [python website][e2]
Some common exceptions include:
- `SyntaxError`: As described, you messed up the syntax. You will get this a lot when starting out.
- `ValueError`: When the value is incorrect like square rooting a negative number.
- `FileNotFound`: You guessed it, either the file does not exist ***OR*** you spelled it wrong. 
- `TypeError`: You used the incorrect type, like adding strings and integers.
- `IndexError`: Index outside the range of the array. 

Whenever possible you should use the builtin [exceptions][e2] but you can create you own custom ones when necessary. 

To use exceptions in your code you want to mimic the following structure:

```python
try:
    # code that will be attempted first
except e as ValueError:
    # Code that will run when the specific expection is encountered, you can have multiple of these to handle different exceptions differently. 
else: 
    # Additionally code that should be run if it is successful
finally: 
    # Addition code that should be run regardless if it encountered an exception or not.

```


## Logging

When you first start using python and you want to test/debug your code, then you like just add print statements to your code.
Well that is not the proper way to do it. 
A much much better way is to use the built in [`logging`][l1] 


## Asynchronous Code

There are often parts of code that can take a long time to complete, say running a web request. Each web request is independent of one another meaning that the output of one does not affect the other. In these cases you can use the `asyncio` package to run multiple web request asynchronously. This can speed up the program quite significantly.

```python
import asyncio
```

For more information, you can check out this [video][a1] or this [blog post][a2].
