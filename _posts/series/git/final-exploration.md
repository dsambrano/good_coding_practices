Misc did covers like gitignore
## Advanced Topics in Git

We covered a lot today, thankfully, that is most of the important things you need. 
However, there are a few advanced topics that I do think are useful to know, even though you might not use them a bunch:
- `.gitignore`: I use this the most on the list. This allows you to tell git to ignore specific files. This is super useful if you have a file that contains any sensative information (e.g., SECRETE_KEYS, Identifiable Subject data, etc.). 
- `git diff `: a function to specifically see what has changed line by line since the last commit
- `git add -p`: patch add in case you make a bunch of changes to a file at once, you can selectively only add parts of the updates to the next commit.

Might not need since there is more to come and this was the warmup.
