<section class="takeaways">

In this blog you will learn basic bash commands. By the end of this you will know:
- Basic commands to traverse your computer from the terminal
- The structure or commands, arguments, and options in `bash`
- How to edit, create, move and delete files
- Create a script to make a folder structure for each new project you are working on. 

Prerequisites:
- None; Although it may be helpful to have read through the series [intro][]

</section>


## Building your knowledge

I need to at least have them make a document and probably a folder, perhaps give them the sense of jubulation from when you see a folder get created on your desktop. 

They probably neeed to edit a file but that does feel like a lot. TBD

Beginning to think we need a part 1 and part 2 cuz its not enough to shotgun a crap ton of commands at the end
Also they need a lot more than this

If I make a part 2 I need to switch the link in the form of a command to be the new page link instead.

I just want to end you with a little spark. This was the moment I got hooked. When I was able to make something on my computer without clicking a button. 
My mind was astounded. 


Looked at the list again, I will be adding the mkdir touch, and mv because they get to show some neatness
Probs also cp 

Def not rm, this will be a explore on your own kinda thing with warning attached.

## The form of Commands

A command is just a mini program that executes when you call it from  a terminal. 
But in order to best understand terminal commands its useful to know how they are structured. 
Every command has 3 basic (potential) parts. 
The command itself, any options you can apply, and finally any arguments. 

As you saw above with the `cd` command, we had an argument (the new directory to change to). 
Again the argument is separated only by a space (no parentheses as you may be used to from other programming languages) and any additional arugment are also separated by a space. 
For the `ls` command we learned about the `-a` option again separated by a space. Options in `bash` start with a `-`. 
It is common practice for single letter options to have a single `-` and full word arguments have two `--`. 

Now that you know how commands are structure the next couple sections will list a bunch of useful basic commands before we end by showing you a way to learn the ins and outs of a command (like its options) and how to find a comand to perform a task you suspect exists. 

### Creating/Deleting/Removing New Folders and Files

For all the commands the relevant arguments will be in `[]`

- `mkdir`: Make Directory (folder) [`name_of_folder_to_make`; use the `-p` (for make parent directories) if you want to make multiple nested folders simultaneously]
- `touch`: Make an Empty File [`name_of_file_to_make`]
- `cp`: Copy [`name_of_file_to_copy`; `name_of_location_to_copy_to`]
- `mv`: Move [`name_of_file_to_move`; `name_of_location_to_move_to`; can also be used to change a files name if you move it to the same location with a new name]
- `rm`: Remove a file [`name_of_file_to_remove`]

### Viewing Contents and Editing Files

- `nano`: A simple to use text editor. You will likely hear about other editors like `vim` or `emacs`. Both are really good, but they have a really hard learning curve, so I don't reccomend them when you start out. I personally use `nvim`, which is a modern replacement for `vim`. [`name_of_file_to_edit`]
- `cat`: Concatenate (prints out files contents) [`name_of_file_to_print`]
- `less`: Less (is more... powerful). Useful for printing out really long docs becuse you can scroll through them [`name_of_file_to_print`]
- `more`: More (of the content on screen) Useful for printing out really long docs but not as good as `less` [`name_of_file_to_print`]

## How to Learn About New Commands

These commands are more important to remember because they let you find a command to do perform and actiona as well as learn how to use that command:

- `apropos`: Ã  propos (meaning with regard to). This command allows you to search for all commands the perform function/have anything in their name/description about a topic. [`descriptiion_or_name` you want to search for]
  >***If you only remember one command this is the one to remember***
- `man`: (Pull up the) Manual (for the respective command so you can learn all the options available) [`command` you want to know more about similar to `help()` or `??` in most languages] 

## Further Exploration

of course we only touched the surface here, I only really showed you commands that allow you to navigate your file systems, but there are loads other commands as well. For example, there are command to access content from the internet `curl` commands that lets you access other computers `ssh` and `vlc`. My goal here was not have a complete bash tutorial, but rather to get you to a position where you can be dangers and importantly, hopefully show you just enough to spark your ideas on how valuable this is. The next step is for you to apply this knowledge. Make some small app that automates away boring things you have to do all the time. You might not now all the commands necessary to complete the task, but that is ok, you can google a command or better yet, try to search for it with apropos.

Some examples my RAs have done in the past include: 

If you are looking for a place to spruce up your terminal, you can check out the modern unix project, where they attempt to update all the old commands to fit the modern age, so they will have lots more colors and 

As you can imagine, this is just a taste of the command line. You can do so so much more. Hopefully this was just enough to wet your appetite, and make you eager to explore more. One great place to start is with [Modern Unix][munix]. This is a project that has upgrades many of the commands we just talked about to fit with the modern world, (e.g., adding colors, speed, etc.). Another way to speed things up is to make alias which you can write short hand for really long commands.

## Homework

Try to make a new folder called `git_repos` somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. 
Then make `README.md` file (for advanced users try `nano` or `vim` to edit it and say something). 

Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). 
Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure:

```shell
my_first_bash_script/
  |-- analyses/
      |-- plots/
  |-- expriment/
      |-- data/
  |-- lit_review/
  |-- supporting_docs/
      |-- scales/
      |-- irb_docs/  
  |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md
  |-- README.md
```

Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. 
I highly highly reccommend two separate `.md` files. 
The `README` is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). 
In contrast the `DEVELOPMENT` file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project.
Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. 
I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. 
This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable.
