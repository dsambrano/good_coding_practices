<section class="takeaways">

In this blog you will learn basic bash commands. By the end of this you will know:
- Basic commands to traverse your computer from the terminal
- The structure or commands, arguments, and options in `bash`
- How to edit, create, move and delete files
- Create a script to make a folder structure for each new project you are working on. 

Prerequisites:
- None; Although it may be helpful to have read through the series [intro][]

## Knowing Your Way Around with `bash`

<!-- excerpt-start -->

When you first learn bash there are three must learn commands. These are really important commands because they allow you to navigate around your file system:

- `pwd`: **P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory
- `cd`: **C**hange **D**irectory
- `ls`: **L**i**S**t (Contents)

An analogy  that I like to use for these commands is imaging you are on a random street in a US city that you don't know. 
The `pwd` command is like looking up your current address. It will tell you were you are. 
The `ls` command would be like looking around the street (or on your map) to see what restruants are on the street. 
And `cd` would be like moving to a new location. 
In keeping with the analogy, you can't just move to an arbritrary new street because you don't know this city. 
Instead you have to give precise directions either from where you are currently or relative to some clearly visable space (say a big colorful building you can see from anywhere in the city). 
Now let's see these in action.

### `pwd`

The `pwd` command shows where you are currently located in your filesystem and is equivalent to `getwd()` in `R` or `os.getcwd()` in `python`.
You will notice that in this tutorial, I have all the code as an image instead of code based text that you can copy. 
This was done intentionally because as you first start out, you could be typing these commands in so you get used to them. 
So for each image, you should be typing out the command on your own terminal and confirming you get similar results.

![pwd](/assets/imgs/pwd.png)

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/pwd.png" alt="pwd" width="150"/> <br><br> -->

As you can see I am in my users home directory (a special location, and super common, location in your files; on Mac its `/user/USERNAME` on linux its `/home/USERNAME`).
This is a super common place, so it has a shortcut that can be accessed with `~` called the tilde and its above tab and to the left of the 1 on the keyboard.

The `~` can be used to access your home directory (a directory is  just another name for a folder) anywhere on your computer.
You'll see more of it later.


### `ls`

So the `pwd` command tells you were you are, the `ls` command let's you look around at the current location, to know what is around you.
So in terms of your filesystem the `ls` command lists all directories and files inside the specified directory (defaults to your current working directory if no directory path is specified). 
I have mine set up to give different colors to folder, which you can ignore for now (at the end of this series I will show you have to customize your terminal to have a fancy terminal as well).

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/ls.png" alt="pwd" width="650"/> -->

#### Arugments

The `ls` command can also take input arguments. Arguments are inputs to a command to adjust its functionality.
In the case of the `ls` command you are add a path as an argument, so instead of listing the contents of the current directory, it will list the contents of the specified directory. Lets try it with our downloads folder:
> Note: That unlike most other programming languages, `bash` does not use parentheses to enclose the arguments. Each on is simply separated by white space.


![ls Error](/assets/imgs/ls-error.png)

ðŸ˜² Uh-ohh, we got an error, what happened? The `ls` command already  said that we have a downloads folder.
Reading the error it says that there is no downloads folder, but thats weird we just saw it in the previous command, what gives?
Well... this is an important lesson.
All shell commands are **CASE SENSITIVE**.
So, while we have a `Downloads` folder, we do not have a folder called `downloads`. That was the problem.
When we correct the case we get this output. 

![ls Downloads](/assets/imgs/ls-downloads.png)

As you can see, I have a bunch of junk in my downloads folder, which I should probably clean out. But, more importantnly, the command worked now that we made sure that we had the correct case.

To help with the case problem, I personally only used lowercase in my directory and file names. This helps out a lot.
I also avoid spaces in file/directory names because to access them you need to prepend the space with a `\`, so if you had a file calle `my first directory` you would need to access it with   `ls my\ first\ directory`.
So its best to avoid spaces altogether. 

Its really important to actually try to impletment these new commands, you will not learn them just by reading this post, you have to actually try them out.
So take a couple mins now to list out the contents of different directories on your computer.


#### Options

In addition to argumnets commands can also have options.
Options typically change how the output is displayed, compared to arugments, which typically affect what the function is performed on.
One simple example of a command is `ls -G`. Test it out to see what it does.

Options as implied by the name are optional, and tend to either be a single `-` if the option is a single letter (like the `-G` example) or two `--` if its a word.

For example, `ls --all` (or the shorthand: `ls -a`) shows all files and directories including the hidden files and directories.
A hidden file and a hidden directory are just one that starts with a `.`.
By default, your OS will hide files and folders starting with `.` when looking for things.
The `ls -a` will reveal their secrets.
Here, I am showing a git repository that has a few hidden folders that would not have been shown without the `-a` option nor would they be shown in Finder/Window Explorer.
In this case, the `.git` folder is one example.


![lsa](/assets/imgs/ls-a.png)
<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/ls-a.png" alt="pwd" width="650"/> --> 


There are tons of other useful options for `ls`. Here are a few noteworthy one.
- `-l` will **L**ong list you files, so it will print out all the metadata as well. 
- `-lh`will long list them in a **H**uman readable format, so you dont have to convert everything from bytes, it will show you them in eith MB, GB, etc, depending on size.

Note that you can combine these options, so try to guess what `ls -lha` would do, then confirm your hypothesis by running the command. 

#### Autocomplete

One incredibly useful technique is autocomplete. 
Anytime you are using the terminal (this also works for most other languages as well), you can hit the tab key to autocomplete your command. 
For example, if I wanted to access the contents of the Desktop, I could type the full thing out or I could just type `ls Desk` and press the tab key and it will autocomplete to `ls Desktop`. 

Taking autocomplete one step further, you can actually acess use tab to list out the contents. So let's say, as is the case for me, you have a folder in your Downloads, but you werent quite sure what you called it. You could type out `ls Dow` pres tab to autocomplete to `ls Downloads/` the press tab twice to list out the contents of your folder like this:

<video autoplay muted loop style='height: 400px'>
  <source src="/assets/videos/autocomplete.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


now you remember that it was called temp so you can type the t and hit autocomplete (or you could just continously hit tab to cycle through the options).
Pretty neat huh, this technique will save you a ton of time, not only because you don't have to type as much, but also so you don't accidently swap cases or make a typo.
**Importantly** autocomplete will work on all shell commands (and many other programming langauges as well), so make sure to keep it in mind for the future commands as well.

Now that you know about autocomplete, I want you to take a few more mins listing out the contents of your directories, but also I want you to have side by side the finder window open to the corresponding folder. Notice how much longer it takes to traverse through the contents when using a the GUI compared to the command line. Of course as you improve you are only going to get better, until you are *blazingly fast*! 

> **Hint**: For `zsh` users you can even type out partial directories and have your shell complete e.g., `cd Do/te` then hit tab it will give you `cd Downloads/temp`.

### `cd`

The counter part `pwd` is the `cd` command, which in the analogy allows you to move from one location to another. 
In your filesystem that means `cd` command allows you to change your current working directory similar to `os.setwd` in `R` and `os.chdir()` in `python`.


![cd](/assets/imgs/cd.png)

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/cd.png" alt="cd" width="150"/> -->

As described in the analogy, the `cd` command helps us move around in our filesystem.
The `pwd` command showed we were in our home directory, but we used the `cd` command just now to move to our Desktop folder.
This is just like if you had Finder or Windows Explore open to that location and move through your files by double clicking the folder icon. 
In fact, now is an excellent time for you to open your files app and place it side by side with your terminal, that way you can see exactly what is happening in both.

With the `cd` command you can specify the location, but like I said in the analogy at the beginnner, you don't know this place, so you have to give precise directions either from where you currently are (relative path), or from a well known place (absolute path). The well known, highly visisble place in your filesystem is that home directory (or your root directory noted with `/`).

Now that we are in the Desktop, you can see the `pwd` command changes its output to reflect our new current working directory.

![PWD from Desktop](/assets/imgs/pwd-desktop.png)

While we are here, of course we can still use the `ls` command to see the contents of the Desktop; however, now that we are currently inside the Desktop folder we can no longer just type `ls Downloads`.
Again, this is because we are in the Desktop folder, and the Desktop folder does **NOT** have a Downloads folder.
This would be like clicking the Downloads folder inside of the Desktop folder on the GUI, you can't because its not there.
So if we want to access the contents of the Downloads folder we have few options. 

First, we could simply `cd` back into our home folder. Since the home folder is one folder above the Desktop folder, we could use the shortcut to move up one folder `cd ..`.

![CD back up one Directory](/assets/imgs/cd-home.png)

Alternatively, since we are specifically trying to go to our home folder, we could also use the special `~` character with `cd ~`.

![CD back to Home Directory](/assets/imgs/cd-tilde.png)

Then once you changed your current working directory you could use `ls Downloads` to access that directories contents.

The other option is to use these techniques along with the `ls` command. So we could use `ls ../Downloads` or ls `ls ~/Downloads/`.
Personally, I switch back an for depending on my needs.
For example, if I am nested deep inside a folder structure I might just use `~` but if I am just one folder off I would use `..`. 

Now, you should be able to try out `cd`ing around your different folder (try hidden ones too!) and use `pwd` to know where you are and `ls` to see what is around you.
Try to make sure you are using all the commands and options we talk about so far. Also test out what happens when you do `cd ../..`

## Recap

We covered a lot just now, so let's recap.
You learned how the `pwd`, `ls`, and the `cd` commands can be used to look around you computer.
You also learn how some commands can have arguments to change what they perform their action on, and options which affect how the output is shown.
Finally, you learned about the special `~` character to always return home.


First of all, these new skills alone are pretty cool and you should pat yourself on the back for your new skills.
However, I do want to show you one quite new things, just to spark your interest for the next tutorial.
When I saw this in action the first time my mind exploded ðŸ¤¯, and I genuinely tried to show everyone I knew.

To get the full effect, I recommand you `cd` to your Desktop but make sure your Desktop is still visible, so you can see if anything changes. Then try running any of the tree commands:

```shell
mkdir my_first_dir
touch my_first_file.txt
echo "Hello, World!" >> my_first_file_with_text.txt
```
