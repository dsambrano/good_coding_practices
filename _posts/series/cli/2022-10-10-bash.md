In this blog you will learn basic bash commands. By the end of this you will know:
- Basic commands to traverse your computer from the terminal
- The structure or commands, arguments, and options in `bash`
- How to edit, create, move and delete files
- Create a script to make a folder structure for each new project you are working on. 

Prerequisites:
- None; Although it may be helpful to have read through the series [intro][]

## Knowing Your Way Around with `bash`

<!-- excerpt-start -->

When you first learn bash there are three must learn commands. These are really important commands because they allow you to navigate around your file system:

- `pwd`: Print Working Directory
- `cd`: Change Directory
- `ls`: LiSt (Contents)

An analogy  that I like to use for these commands is imaging you are on a random street in a US city that you don't know. 
The `pwd` command is like looking up your current address. It will tell you were you are. 
The `ls` command would be like looking around the street (or on your map) to see what restruants are on the street. 
And `cd` would be like moving to a new location. 
In keeping with the analogy, you can't just move to an arbritrary new street because you don't know this city. 
Instead you have to give precise directions either from where you are currently or relative to some clearly visable space (say a big colorful building you can see from anywhere in the city). 
Now let's see these in action.

### `pwd`

The `pwd` command shows where you are currently located in your filesystem and is equivalent to `getwd()` in `R` or `os.getcwd()` in `python`. 

```shell
~ pwd 
/user/deshawn
```
![pwd](/assets/imgs/pwd.png)

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/pwd.png" alt="pwd" width="150"/> <br><br> -->

As you can see I am in my users home directory (a special location, and super common, location in your files; on Mac its `/user/USERNAME` on linux its `/home/USERNAME`).
This is a super common place, so it has a shortcut that can be accessed with `~` called the tilde and its above tab and to the left of the 1 on the keyboard.

The `~` can be used to access your home directory (a directory is  just another name for a folder) anywhere on your computer.
You'll see more of it later.

> **Hint**: Capitalization matters so make sure you keep that in mind. 
I personally always have my folders named with lowercase letters to make this easier. 
Simlarly, spaces require an espace `\`, so I also avoid spaces in directory names (typically using `_`'s).


### `ls`

So the `pwd` command tells you were you are, the `ls` command let's you look around at the current location, to know what is around you.
So in terms of your filesystem the `ls` command lists all directories and files inside the specified directory (defaults to your current working directory if no directory path is specified). 
I have mine set up to give different colors to folder, which you can ignore for now (at the end of this series I will show you have to customize your terminal to have a fancy terminal as well). 
>**Hint**: This command works for me because I have a folder on my computer called `git_repos/good_coding_practices`, but you probably do not. You can either make one to follow along or even better use a different folder to see the files there. 
But separate from that I will teach you about the optional argument `-a`:

```shell
 bin         Downloads   GoXLR.cfg      patchbay_double.qpwgraph                Public      Videos
 Desktop     gems        Music          patchbay_double_all_to_astro.qpwgraph   R           workshop
 Documents   git_repos   OpenRGB.json   Pictures                                Templates 
```

```shell
➜  ls git_repos/good_coding_practices
README.md         git.md            imgs              modeling.md       pwd.png
cli.md            good_practices.md markdown.md       productivity.md   python.md
```

![ls](/assets/imgs/ls.png)

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/ls.png" alt="pwd" width="650"/> -->

Just like the `cd` command, the `ls` command can also take input arguments, if you wanted to see the contents of a folder you were not currently in.
Additionally, you can use differnt options with the `ls` command.
These options are specified with a `-` when its a single letter or `--` when its a word.

For example, `ls -a` (a for all) shows all hidden files and directories in addition to the nonhidden ones. 
A hidden file and a hidden direcotry are just one that starts with a `.`.
By default, your OS will hide files and folders starting with `.` when looking for things.
The `ls -a` will reveal their secrets.
In out case, the `.git` folder is one example.

### `cd`


The `cd` command allows you to change your current working directory similar to `os.setwd` in `R` and `os.chdir()` in `python`. Unlike most programming languages you are might be familiar with, in `bash` you don't have parentheses.
The arguments are just placed after the command separated by a space. 
For more info about the structure of `bash` scripting [see below][bash-structure]

> **Hint**: Before finishing the location you want to go, you can hit tab to autocomplete the argument. 
This is invaluable and will save so much time to working memeory capcity so definitely try it out. 
Also for `zsh` users you can even type out partial directories and have your shell complete e.g., `cd De/git` will give `cd` to my `Desktop/github_repo` directory. 

```shell
~ cd Desktop
~/Desktop
```

![cd](/assets/imgs/cd.png)

<!-- <img src="assets/imgs/cd.png" alt="cd" width="150"/> -->

As described in the analogy, the `cd` command helps us move around in our filesystem.
The `pwd` command showed we were in our home directory, but we used the `cd` command just now to move to our Desktop.
This is just like if you had Finder or Windows Explore open to that location and move through your files by double clicking the folder icon. 

With the `cd` command you can specify the location, but like I said in the analogy at the beginnner, you don't know this place, so you have to give direction either from where you currently are, or from a well known plce. The well known, highly visisble place in your filesystem is that home directory. 

Try `cd`ing around to other common locations like the Downloads folder

The next command will help us look around, so I would recommend you adding a 

## Building your knowledge

I need to at least have them make a document and probably a folder, perhaps give them the sense of jubulation from when you see a folder get created on your desktop. 

They probably neeed to edit a file but that does feel like a lot. TBD

Beginning to think we need a part 1 and part 2 cuz its not enough to shotgun a crap ton of commands at the end
Also they need a lot more than this

If I make a part 2 I need to switch the link in the form of a command to be the new page link instead.

I just want to end you with a little spark. This was the moment I got hooked. When I was able to make something on my computer without clicking a button. 
My mind was astounded. 


Looked at the list again, I will be adding the mkdir touch, and mv because they get to show some neatness
Probs also cp 

Def not rm, this will be a explore on your own kinda thing with warning attached.

## The form of Commands

A command is just a mini program that executes when you call it from  a terminal. 
But in order to best understand terminal commands its useful to know how they are structured. 
Every command has 3 basic (potential) parts. 
The command itself, any options you can apply, and finally any arguments. 

As you saw above with the `cd` command, we had an argument (the new directory to change to). 
Again the argument is separated only by a space (no parentheses as you may be used to from other programming languages) and any additional arugment are also separated by a space. 
For the `ls` command we learned about the `-a` option again separated by a space. Options in `bash` start with a `-`. 
It is common practice for single letter options to have a single `-` and full word arguments have two `--`. 

Now that you know how commands are structure the next couple sections will list a bunch of useful basic commands before we end by showing you a way to learn the ins and outs of a command (like its options) and how to find a comand to perform a task you suspect exists. 

### Creating/Deleting/Removing New Folders and Files

For all the commands the relevant arguments will be in `[]`

- `mkdir`: Make Directory (folder) [`name_of_folder_to_make`; use the `-p` (for make parent directories) if you want to make multiple nested folders simultaneously]
- `touch`: Make an Empty File [`name_of_file_to_make`]
- `cp`: Copy [`name_of_file_to_copy`; `name_of_location_to_copy_to`]
- `mv`: Move [`name_of_file_to_move`; `name_of_location_to_move_to`; can also be used to change a files name if you move it to the same location with a new name]
- `rm`: Remove a file [`name_of_file_to_remove`]

### Viewing Contents and Editing Files

- `nano`: A simple to use text editor. You will likely hear about other editors like `vim` or `emacs`. Both are really good, but they have a really hard learning curve, so I don't reccomend them when you start out. I personally use `nvim`, which is a modern replacement for `vim`. [`name_of_file_to_edit`]
- `cat`: Concatenate (prints out files contents) [`name_of_file_to_print`]
- `less`: Less (is more... powerful). Useful for printing out really long docs becuse you can scroll through them [`name_of_file_to_print`]
- `more`: More (of the content on screen) Useful for printing out really long docs but not as good as `less` [`name_of_file_to_print`]

## How to Learn About New Commands

These commands are more important to remember because they let you find a command to do perform and actiona as well as learn how to use that command:

- `apropos`: à propos (meaning with regard to). This command allows you to search for all commands the perform function/have anything in their name/description about a topic. [`descriptiion_or_name` you want to search for]
  >***If you only remember one command this is the one to remember***
- `man`: (Pull up the) Manual (for the respective command so you can learn all the options available) [`command` you want to know more about similar to `help()` or `??` in most languages] 

## Further Exploration

As you can imagine, this is just a taste of the command line. You can do so so much more. Hopefully this was just enough to wet your appetite, and make you eager to explore more. One great place to start is with [Modern Unix][munix]. This is a project that has upgrades many of the commands we just talked about to fit with the modern world, (e.g., adding colors, speed, etc.). Another way to speed things up is to make alias which you can write short hand for really long commands.

## Homework

Try to make a new folder called `git_repos` somewhere on your computer and either move or copy a file into. 
Then make `README.md` file (for advanced users try `nano` or `vim` to edit it and say something). 

Finally, make a file that can setup a folder structure for all new projects (we didnt discuss how to make workable scripts, but thats ok you can just copy and paste for now). 
Inside the newly created folder you should you should have a the following structure:

```shell
my_first_bash_script/
  |-- analyses/
      |-- plots/
  |-- expriment/
      |-- data/
  |-- lit_review/
  |-- supporting_docs/
      |-- scales/
      |-- irb_docs/  
  |-- DEVELOPEMENT_DECISIONS.md
  |-- README.md
```

Feel free to mess around with this structure a bit to suit your own needs, but having some basic structure for all projects is very important. 
I highly highly reccommend two separate `.md` files. 
The `README` is for anyone first coming to the project on how/why to run this code and what is found were (this can be updated at the very end of the project when it is read to be published). 
In contrast the `DEVELOPMENT` file is a place where you should write down every decision you made for the project.
Why did you use this library instead of that on, why did you have 60 trials instead of 90, why did you exclude a subject etc. 
I personally also leave a ton of links to stack[exchange/overflow] for how I came up with code or to justify certain things to myself. 
This file can also be private and not actually published anywhere if you prefer, but trust me, especially when writing a methods sections this is invaluable.
