Final thoughts/things I didnt cover:
$(( math ))
${parameter expansion}

```bash
test="weeh"
echo $test  # ðŸ‘‰ weeh
echo ${test}  # ðŸ‘‰ weeh
echo $(test)  # No response because it is not a command
```

$(commandexpansion)
Good case is `cd`
startingdirectory=$(cd)

```bash
which ls  # ðŸ‘‰ ls=lsd
${which ls}  # error bad substitution
echo "Now we can include the output of commands: $(which ls)" 
# ðŸ‘‰ Now we can include the output of commands: ls=lsd
```

| notation to pipe one command into another and 

Adding comments #
