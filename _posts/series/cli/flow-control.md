This is a intermediate-level follow up to the cli. Specifically you will learn:
- How to make a bash script (Setting a language with Shebang `#!`; Changing permissions `chmod`)
- Taking in arguments/user input for your script
- Change your `$PATH` to run scripts anywhere
- What is `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`

Prerequisites:

- Knowledge of basic shell commands 
- Read through the [Command line (Bash/Zsh)](cli.md)

## Control the Flow of Your Program

Another foundational skill for programming is control how, when, and what parts of your program get executed and when.
Some examples might be, you may only want to run one command if the previous command also worked, or you may want to run one command if the previous one failed.
Or maybe you want to make/change a variable based on another variable.
All of these are example of controlling the flow of your application.

## Controlling a single line

Need to talk about `||` and `&&` in addition to if else and switch case


## If Statements
