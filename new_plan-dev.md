New Plan:



The files all get renamed to bash-basics# where # is obviously replaced

New series intermediate level skills in bash

Something like Taking your bash skills to the next level "in the previous intro series you learned ... Now you are going to take it up a notch. Here you will learn scripts PATHS...

Need to update all links as well, but probs should make that at the very end, just dont want to forget tho 

Probs need to split cli start to have two one on CLIs and set motivation then BASH install/terminal open. But problem, do we need to be together since definitions are the same?


===========================================
New Structure for Series, if Possible

Category/Series/series-name#, where # is replaces with series order
then I have category for general content in that area

path "_posts/*/" stays the same

path "_posts/series", switches to "_posts/*/series/"
and the permalink for it goes to "/:categories/series/:title/



=======
Myths of Coding
Osmosis - more like math
Need to know more before you start

Perhaps one of the most common pitfalls I see for new people is feeling like they need to know a little bit more to get started.
As a result, they end up going watching or reading "just one more tutorial".
The problem is you will never feel like you know enough.
The only way to learn this is by actually trying to build something.

Myth you need to know everything to start coding

=============================================
Steps to Production

1. Edit All files in posts/* what have date
2. Fix All decorations (takeaways, diff level, series diff level, series-nav update to Raspberry pi style, series bubble with series name)
3. Pull Out links to data folder (images too?)
4. Reorganize files/series structure (including config, Collections as an option, https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/#setup, https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/#collections)
4.5. Figure out which Files are going out at start and which are saved for weekly post? (Git newest? probs and Comp modeling could wait also, I want Terminal custom near top probs)
4.75. Publish Repo?
5. Add Search (basic)? https://blog.webjeda.com/instant-jekyll-search/
6. Add Git Comments https://utteranc.es/
---- Prod
* Of course in conjunction with adding new content
7. Copy Code Snippets (js to allow you to copy the code highlight sections
8. Advanced Search: (Google: https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-search/)
9. (Might move up if search is difficult) Add Code snippet style (Need lots of thinking for this one tho)
