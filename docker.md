## What is Docker and Why should I learn it?

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a application to create isolated coding/development environment.
For researchers, perhaps its best use case is that you can have have a docker container that you made on your work/personal machine that you can know will work on the stimulus pc (the computer used for running participants).
Anyone that has created software and needed to transport it to another computer (let alone another OS; e.g., MacOS to Windows 10) will know that it is something ALWAYS goes wrong. 
Sometimes its a relatively simple fix; but sometimes it can take hours to figure out just what is the issue is. 
Well if you set up everything in a docker container it is self contained, so you know for sure that it will work.
Its like packaging together all of the requirements all into a single app that can be run on any computer.
