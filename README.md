## Your Coding Buddy Blog

This is the corresponding repo for [my coding blog][blog].
There are several blogs here desgined to help improve programming efficacy and efficiency.
In order to best utilize this resource, I reccommend the following:
- Save the [blog][] link, so you can visit this site as more information is added
- Although it may be tempting to simplely read through the blog posts, the most helpful parts are the examples/extra practice at the end. To maximize your learning, I highly reccomend you go through these!
