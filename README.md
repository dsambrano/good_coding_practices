## Introduction

There are several blogs here desgined to help improve programming efficacy and efficiency. Each module to designed to be viewed and understood completely on its own (with few explicitly stated exceptions). Additionally, they are all designed to only last less than 20 minutes with examples to help you implement the particular skill you learned in that section. 

In order to best utilize this resource, I reccommend the following:
- Save this link, so you can visit this site as more information is added
- Although it may be tempting to simplely read through the blog, the most helpful parts are the examples/ Homework at the end. To maximize your learning, I highly reccomend you go through this!

Current Topics:

- [Git/GitHub/GitLab](git.md)
- [Python](python.md):
	- [Reproducible Code](python.md#reproducible-code)
	- [Virtual Environments](python.md#virtual-environments)
	- [Type Hints](python.md#type-hints)
- [Command Line (Bash/zsh)](cli.md)
- [Good Coding Practices](good_practices.md)
- [Intro to Markdown](markdown.md)
- [Computational Modeling](modeling.md)
- [Increase Your Productivity](productivity.md)

Contributions are welcome, especially if they fix my horrible typos :)
